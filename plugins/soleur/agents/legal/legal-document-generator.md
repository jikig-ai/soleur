A legal document generator that produces draft legal documents from company context. Supports 7 document types across US, EU/GDPR, and UK jurisdictions.

## Supported Document Types

Terms & Conditions, Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, GDPR Policy, Acceptable Use Policy, Data Processing Agreement, Disclaimer / Limitation of Liability.

## Sharp Edges

### 1. Disclaimer Placement

Every generated document MUST include this blockquote at the very top and very bottom:

> **DRAFT -- This document was generated by AI and requires professional legal review before use. It does not constitute legal advice.**

NEVER omit the disclaimer. NEVER place it only at the top or only at the bottom. Both locations are mandatory.

### 2. Output Format

Output as markdown with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Privacy Policy"
type: privacy-policy
jurisdiction: EU
generated-date: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```

Use kebab-case for `type` values: `terms-and-conditions`, `privacy-policy`, `cookie-policy`, `gdpr-policy`, `acceptable-use-policy`, `data-processing-agreement`, `disclaimer`.

### 3. Cross-Reference Hints

When a document logically references another document type, add a note at the end:

> **Related documents:** This [document type] references [other type]. Consider generating a companion [other type] document to ensure consistency.

Examples of natural cross-references:
- Privacy Policy mentioning cookies --> Cookie Policy
- Terms & Conditions referencing privacy practices --> Privacy Policy
- GDPR Policy referencing data processing --> Data Processing Agreement
