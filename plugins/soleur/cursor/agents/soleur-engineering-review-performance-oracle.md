description: "Use this agent when you need to analyze code for performance issues, optimize algorithms, identify bottlenecks, or ensure scalability. This includes reviewing database queries, memory usage, caching strategies, and overall system performance. The agent should be invoked after implementing features or when performance concerns arise."

On Cursor, do not call the Skill tool, the Task tool, `run_subagent`, or AwaitShell, and do not expand `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`. If the canonical file tells you to call those tools, stop. Slice 1 does not run hooks, does not classify the session as cursor, and does not block a commit.

Read `agents/engineering/review/performance-oracle.md`, relative to the plugin root.
