# Issue Templates by Detail Level

Select how comprehensive you want the issue to be, simpler is mostly better.

## MINIMAL (Quick Issue)

**Best for:** Simple bugs, small improvements, clear features

**Includes:**

- Problem statement or feature description
- Basic acceptance criteria
- Essential context only

**Structure:**

````markdown

# [Issue Title]

[Brief problem/feature description]

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Core requirement 1
- [ ] Core requirement 2

## Test Scenarios

Derive from acceptance criteria. Use Given/When/Then format:

- Given [precondition], when [action], then [expected result]
- Given [edge case], when [action], then [expected handling]

## Context

[Any critical information]

## MVP

### test.rb

```ruby
class Test
  def initialize
    @name = "test"
  end
end
```
