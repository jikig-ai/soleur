# Reproduce Bug Command

Look at github issue #$ARGUMENTS and read the issue description and comments.

## Phase 1: Log Investigation

Think about the places it could go wrong looking at the codebase. Look for logging output we can look for.

Search application logs, error tracking, and recent git history for clues:

1. Check recent commits related to the affected area
2. Search for error messages or stack traces in logs
3. Inspect the relevant code paths for potential failure points

Keep investigating until you have a good idea of what is going on.

## Phase 2: Visual Reproduction with Playwright

If the bug is UI-related or involves user flows, use Playwright to visually reproduce it:

### Step 1: Verify Server is Running

```
mcp__plugin_soleur_pw__browser_navigate({ url: "http://localhost:3000" })
mcp__plugin_soleur_pw__browser_snapshot({})
```

If server not running, inform user to start `bin/dev`.

### Step 2: Navigate to Affected Area

Based on the issue description, navigate to the relevant page:

```
mcp__plugin_soleur_pw__browser_navigate({ url: "http://localhost:3000/[affected_route]" })
mcp__plugin_soleur_pw__browser_snapshot({})
```

### Step 3: Capture Screenshots

Take screenshots at each step of reproducing the bug:

```
mcp__plugin_soleur_pw__browser_take_screenshot({ filename: "bug-[issue]-step-1.png" })
```

### Step 4: Follow User Flow

Reproduce the exact steps from the issue:

1. **Read the issue's reproduction steps**
2. **Execute each step using Playwright:**
   - `browser_click` for clicking elements
   - `browser_type` for filling forms
   - `browser_snapshot` to see the current state
   - `browser_take_screenshot` to capture evidence

3. **Check for console errors:**
   ```
   mcp__plugin_soleur_pw__browser_console_messages({ level: "error" })
   ```

### Step 5: Capture Bug State

When you reproduce the bug:

1. Take a screenshot of the bug state
2. Capture console errors
3. Document the exact steps that triggered it

```
mcp__plugin_soleur_pw__browser_take_screenshot({ filename: "bug-[issue]-reproduced.png" })
```

## Phase 3: Document Findings

**Reference Collection:**

- [ ] Document all research findings with specific file paths (e.g., `app/services/example_service.rb:42`)
- [ ] Include screenshots showing the bug reproduction
- [ ] List console errors if any
- [ ] Document the exact reproduction steps

## Phase 4: Report Back

Add a comment to the issue with:

1. **Findings** - What you discovered about the cause
2. **Reproduction Steps** - Exact steps to reproduce (verified)
3. **Screenshots** - Visual evidence of the bug (upload captured screenshots)
4. **Relevant Code** - File paths and line numbers
5. **Suggested Fix** - If you have one
