**Soleur -- Company-as-a-Service Platform**

**Effective Date:** February 20, 2026
**Last Updated:** February 20, 2026

---

## 1. Introduction

This GDPR Policy explains how Soleur ("we", "us", "our") approaches data protection and privacy in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 ("GDPR") and related European data protection legislation. Soleur is a Company-as-a-Service platform delivered as a Claude Code plugin, providing a full-stack AI organization with 45 agents, 45 skills, and a compounding knowledge base for solo founders and technical builders.

This policy applies to all individuals located in the European Economic Area ("EEA") who use or interact with Soleur, including the plugin software, documentation site, and GitHub repository.

---

## 2. Data Controller and Processor Status

### 2.1 Soleur's Role

Soleur operates as a **locally installed CLI plugin**. All data generated, processed, and stored by the plugin resides exclusively on the user's local machine. Soleur does not collect, transmit, receive, or store any personal data on its own servers.

As a result, **Soleur does not act as a data processor** within the meaning of Article 4(8) of the GDPR with respect to user content, knowledge-base files, or any data created through the plugin's operation.

However, Soleur may act as a **data controller** in a limited capacity for: (a) the documentation site hosted on GitHub Pages, where standard web server logs (IP addresses, browser metadata) may be collected via GitHub's infrastructure, and (b) the GitHub repository, where issue reports and contributions involve processing of GitHub profile data. In both cases, the processing is minimal and relies on third-party infrastructure (GitHub).

### 2.2 Third-Party Services

Users should be aware that interacting with Soleur may involve third-party services that have their own data controller or processor roles:

- **Anthropic (Claude API):** When users invoke Soleur agents and skills, requests are sent to Anthropic's Claude API using the user's own API key. Anthropic acts as an independent data controller or processor under its own terms and privacy policy. Soleur does not intermediate, intercept, or store any data exchanged between the user and Anthropic.
- **GitHub Pages (Documentation Site):** The Soleur documentation site at [soleur.ai](https://soleur.ai) is hosted on GitHub Pages. GitHub may collect IP addresses, browser metadata, and other standard web server logs. GitHub acts as the data controller for this data under its own privacy statement.
- **GitHub (Repository):** Users who interact with the Soleur repository (issues, pull requests, discussions) do so under GitHub's terms and privacy policies. GitHub is the data controller for repository interaction data.

---

## 3. Lawful Basis for Processing

### 3.1 Plugin Operation (Local Processing)

Because Soleur processes all data locally on the user's device and does not transmit personal data to Soleur-controlled infrastructure, there is no personal data processing by Soleur that requires a lawful basis under Article 6 of the GDPR.

### 3.2 Documentation Site

To the extent that GitHub Pages collects data when users visit soleur.ai, the lawful basis is **legitimate interest** (Article 6(1)(f)) -- specifically, the interest in providing and maintaining accessible product documentation. Users are directed to GitHub's own privacy documentation for specifics on data collected by GitHub Pages.

---

## 4. Categories of Personal Data

### 4.1 Data NOT Collected by Soleur

Soleur does not collect, store, or process the following categories of personal data:

- Names, email addresses, or contact information
- Account credentials or authentication tokens
- IP addresses or device identifiers
- Location data
- Financial or payment information
- Usage analytics or telemetry
- Content generated through the plugin (knowledge-base files, brainstorms, plans, code)

### 4.2 Data That May Be Processed by Third Parties

The following data may be processed by third-party services when users interact with the broader Soleur ecosystem:

| Category | Third Party | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| IP address, browser metadata | GitHub (via GitHub Pages) | Hosting documentation site |
| Prompts, code context | Anthropic (via Claude API) | Powering AI agent responses (user authenticates with own credentials) |
| GitHub account data | GitHub (via repository) | Issue tracking, contributions |

Users are responsible for reviewing the privacy policies of these third-party services.

## 5. Data Subject Rights

Under the GDPR, data subjects in the EEA have the following rights. Because Soleur does not collect or process personal data, most of these rights are exercisable only against the relevant third-party service providers:

### 5.1 Rights Exercisable Against Third Parties

- **Right of Access (Article 15):** Contact Anthropic or GitHub directly to request access to personal data they hold.
- **Right to Rectification (Article 16):** Contact the relevant third party to correct inaccurate personal data.
- **Right to Erasure (Article 17):** Request deletion of personal data from Anthropic or GitHub under applicable conditions.
- **Right to Restriction of Processing (Article 18):** Request that Anthropic or GitHub restrict processing of your data.
- **Right to Data Portability (Article 20):** Request your data in a portable format from the relevant third party.
- **Right to Object (Article 21):** Object to processing by the relevant third party.

### 5.2 Rights Exercisable Locally

- **Right to Erasure of Local Data:** Because all Soleur plugin data is stored on your local machine, you have full and immediate control over its deletion. Uninstalling the plugin and deleting the plugin directory removes all associated data.
- **Right to Access Local Data:** All knowledge-base files, plans, brainstorms, and other artifacts are stored as plaintext files on your filesystem and are fully accessible to you at all times.

### 5.3 Supervisory Authority

Data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority in the EU Member State of their habitual residence, place of work, or place of the alleged infringement. A list of EU Data Protection Authorities is available at [edpb.europa.eu](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en).

---

## 6. International Data Transfers

Soleur itself does not transfer personal data internationally. However, users should be aware that:

- **Anthropic Claude API:** API requests may be processed in the United States or other jurisdictions where Anthropic operates. Users should review Anthropic's data processing terms regarding international transfer safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses, adequacy decisions).
- **GitHub Pages / GitHub:** GitHub infrastructure is located globally, including in the United States. GitHub relies on Standard Contractual Clauses and other transfer mechanisms. See GitHub's Global Privacy Practices documentation.

Users who are subject to the GDPR and have concerns about international data transfers should review the relevant third-party policies before using these services.

---

## 7. Data Security Measures

### 7.1 Local Security

Because Soleur operates entirely on the user's local machine:

- All data remains within the user's filesystem security perimeter.
- No data is transmitted to Soleur-controlled servers or cloud storage.
- Users are responsible for securing their own devices, including filesystem permissions, disk encryption, and access controls.
- API keys (e.g., Anthropic API keys) are managed locally by the user and are never collected or stored by Soleur.

### 7.2 Recommendations for Users

To maintain data protection when using Soleur, we recommend:

- Enabling full-disk encryption on your device.
- Using strong access controls for your user account.
- Keeping your API keys secure and rotating them periodically.
- Reviewing the security practices of third-party services (Anthropic, GitHub) before use.
- Not including sensitive personal data of third parties in knowledge-base files unless you have a lawful basis to do so.

---

## 8. Data Retention

### 8.1 Local Data

Soleur does not impose any retention period on locally stored data. Files persist on the user's machine until the user deletes them. Users have full control over the lifecycle of all locally stored artifacts.

### 8.2 Third-Party Retention

Retention periods for data held by Anthropic and GitHub are governed by their respective privacy policies and data retention schedules.

---

## 9. Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)

Given that Soleur's own data processing is limited to standard web hosting (via GitHub Pages) and community repository interactions, a formal DPIA under Article 35 of the GDPR is not required for Soleur's direct operations, as the processing does not meet the high-risk thresholds defined in Article 35(3).

**Important for users:** If you use Soleur's AI agents to process personal data of third parties (e.g., including personal data in knowledge-base files, feeding personal data to the Anthropic API via agent prompts), **you** may be required to conduct a DPIA under Article 35. This is your responsibility as the data controller for locally processed data.

---

## 10. Children's Data

Soleur is designed for professional use by solo founders and technical builders. It is not directed at children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. Because Soleur does not collect personal data from any users, no specific age-verification mechanism is implemented.

---

## 11. Changes to This Policy

We may update this GDPR Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, third-party services, or applicable law. Updates will be published in the Soleur GitHub repository at [github.com/jikig-ai/soleur](https://github.com/jikig-ai/soleur) and, where significant, noted in the project changelog.

We encourage users to review this policy periodically.

Soleur is an open-source project maintained by Jikigai, a company incorporated in France, with its registered office at 25 rue de Ponthieu, 75008 Paris, France.

Soleur's limited data processing (standard web hosting, community repository interactions) does not meet the thresholds requiring a Data Protection Officer (DPO) under Article 37 of the GDPR: the processing is not core business activity involving regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects at large scale, nor does it involve large-scale processing of special categories of data. Accordingly, no DPO has been appointed. Should this assessment change, DPO contact information will be added to this policy.
