Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Soleur project ("Project"), maintained by Jikigai ("We" or "Us"), a company incorporated in France with its registered office at 25 rue de Ponthieu, 75008 Paris, France.

This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") defines the terms under which You submit Contributions to the Project. By signing this Agreement, You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions submitted to the Project.

## 1. Definitions

- **"You" (or "Your")** means the individual who submits a Contribution to the Project. If Your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that You create that includes Your Contributions, You represent that You have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that Your employer has waived such rights for Your Contributions to the Project, or that Your employer has signed a Corporate Contributor License Agreement with Us.

- **"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to the Project for inclusion in, or documentation of, the Project. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Project or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Project, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

## 2. Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Us and to recipients of software distributed by Us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works. You further grant to Us the right to sublicense these rights through multiple tiers of sublicensees, and the right to relicense Your Contributions under any license terms selected by Us, including proprietary and commercial license terms.

## 3. Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Us and to recipients of software distributed by Us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer Your Contributions, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Project to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.

This patent license grant does not extend to patents that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the Project after Your Contribution is incorporated.

**Note regarding moral rights:** In jurisdictions where moral rights (such as droits moraux under French law) are inalienable and cannot be waived, this Agreement does not require the waiver of such rights. You agree not to assert any moral rights in a way that would impede the exercise of the licenses granted herein, to the extent permitted by applicable law.

## 4. Representations

You represent that:

(a) You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses. If Your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that You create that includes Your Contributions, You represent that You have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that Your employer has waived such rights for Your Contributions to the Project, or that Your employer has signed a Corporate Contributor License Agreement with Us.

(b) Each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see Section 6 for submissions on behalf of others).

(c) Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which You are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

(d) You understand that the Project and Your Contributions are public, and that a record of the Contribution (including all personal information You submit with it, such as Your GitHub username) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with this Agreement and the license(s) involved.

## 5. Support and Warranty Disclaimer

You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

## 6. Third-Party Contributions

Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to the Project separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which You are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]."

## 7. Notification

You agree to notify Us of any facts or circumstances of which You become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.

## 8. Miscellaneous

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of France, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Any disputes arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Paris, France.

(b) This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement between You and Us regarding Your Contributions to the Project and supersedes all prior agreements, negotiations, and discussions between the parties relating thereto.

(c) If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

(d) A waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of any other provision, and any failure to enforce any provision shall not constitute a waiver of future enforcement.

(e) The license grants in Sections 2 and 3 of this Agreement are irrevocable and survive termination of this Agreement. If You later request deletion of Your signature record (for example, under GDPR), the license grants made under this Agreement continue in full effect for all Contributions made prior to such deletion.
