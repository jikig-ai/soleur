**Effective Date:** February 20, 2026

**Last Updated:** February 20, 2026

This Data Protection Disclosure ("DPD") describes the data processing relationship between:

- **Soleur** ("Provider," "we," "us," or "our"), the developer and maintainer of the Soleur Claude Code plugin, accessible at [https://soleur.ai](https://soleur.ai) and the GitHub repository [jikig-ai/soleur](https://github.com/jikig-ai/soleur); and

- **You** ("User," "Controller," or "you"), the individual or entity using the Soleur plugin.

This DPD supplements our [Terms and Conditions](/docs/legal/terms-and-conditions.md) and [Privacy Policy](/docs/legal/privacy-policy.md) and transparently describes the data processing relationship under the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 ("GDPR"). Because Soleur is not a data processor (see Section 2), this is not a Data Processing Agreement under Article 28. It is a disclosure document that clarifies data handling responsibilities.

Soleur is an open-source project maintained by Jikigai, a company incorporated in France, with its registered office at 25 rue de Ponthieu, 75008 Paris, France.

## 2. Data Processing Relationship Classification

### 2.1 Soleur Is Not a Data Processor

**This section is critical to understanding the data processing relationship.**

The Soleur Plugin operates entirely on the User's local machine. It is installed via CLI and runs as a local extension within the User's development environment. Soleur does not operate cloud infrastructure, servers, or hosted services that process User data.

As a result:

- **(a)** Soleur does **not** process Personal Data on behalf of the User within the meaning of Article 28 of the GDPR.
- **(b)** Soleur does **not** have access to, collect, store, transmit, or otherwise process any Local Data created or managed through the Plugin.
- **(c)** All knowledge-base files, plans, brainstorms, specs, generated code, and other artifacts remain exclusively on the User's local filesystem under the User's sole control.
- **(d)** Soleur does **not** act as an intermediary for any API calls made by the User to third-party services (including, but not limited to, the Anthropic Claude API). Users authenticate directly with third-party services using their own API keys and credentials.

**Therefore, Soleur is neither a Controller nor a Processor with respect to the data processed locally through the Plugin.**

### 2.2 User's Responsibilities as Controller

The User is solely responsible for:

- **(a)** All Personal Data processed on their local machine through use of the Plugin;
- **(b)** Ensuring a lawful basis for any processing of Personal Data that occurs through their use of the Plugin;
- **(c)** Compliance with GDPR and other applicable data protection laws with respect to data processed locally;
- **(d)** Securing their local environment, including filesystem permissions, encryption, and access controls;
- **(e)** Managing API keys and credentials used to interact with third-party services; and
- **(f)** Any data shared with third-party services (e.g., Anthropic Claude API) through the Plugin's functionality, including compliance with those services' own data processing terms.

### 2.3 Limited Processing by Soleur

Soleur's data processing activities are limited to:

- **(a)** **Docs Site hosting:** The Soleur documentation website is hosted on GitHub Pages. GitHub may collect standard web server logs, including IP addresses, browser user-agent strings, and page request data. This processing is governed by [GitHub's Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).
- **(b)** **GitHub repository interaction:** Users who submit issues, pull requests, or participate in discussions on the Soleur GitHub repository interact with GitHub's platform. This processing is governed by GitHub's terms and privacy policies.
- **(c)** **Plugin distribution:** The Plugin is distributed via GitHub and npm. Download and installation telemetry is handled by those respective platforms under their own privacy policies.

For these limited activities, Soleur acts as a Controller only with respect to data it directly collects (if any), and GitHub acts as a Processor or independent Controller as described in its own agreements.

---

## 3. Technical and Organizational Measures

### 3.1 Local-Only Architecture

Soleur's architecture is designed to minimize data processing concerns:

- **(a)** The Plugin executes entirely within the User's local CLI environment.
- **(b)** No data is transmitted to Soleur-operated servers.
- **(c)** No telemetry, analytics, or usage tracking is embedded in the Plugin itself.
- **(d)** The Plugin does not establish network connections to Soleur-controlled endpoints.

### 3.2 User-Side Security Recommendations

While Soleur does not process User data, we recommend the following security measures for Users:

- **(a)** Use encrypted filesystems for local data storage.
- **(b)** Restrict filesystem permissions on knowledge-base directories and generated artifacts.
- **(c)** Rotate and securely store API keys used with third-party services.
- **(d)** Review the data you send to third-party APIs (e.g., Anthropic Claude API) and ensure compliance with your own data protection obligations.
- **(e)** Maintain access controls on the development environment where the Plugin is installed.

---

## 4. Third-Party Services and Sub-processors

### 4.1 No Sub-processors

Because Soleur does not process Personal Data on behalf of Users, there are no Sub-processors to disclose under Article 28(2) of the GDPR.

### 4.2 Third-Party Services Used by Users

Users may interact with the following third-party services through the Plugin's functionality. These interactions are initiated and controlled by the User, not by Soleur:

| Service | Purpose | User's Relationship |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| Anthropic (Claude API) | AI model inference | Direct customer of Anthropic |
| GitHub | Code hosting, issue tracking | Direct customer of GitHub |
| npm | Package distribution | Direct customer of npm |

Users are responsible for reviewing and complying with the data processing terms of any third-party service they use in conjunction with the Plugin.

---

## 5. Data Subject Rights

### 5.1 Local Data

Because Soleur does not have access to Local Data, data subject requests (access, rectification, erasure, portability, restriction, objection) related to data processed locally must be addressed by the User directly. Soleur cannot fulfill such requests as it has no access to the data.

### 5.2 Docs Site and GitHub Data

For data processed through the Docs Site or GitHub repository:

- **(a)** Users may exercise their data subject rights by contacting us through the [Soleur GitHub repository](https://github.com/jikig-ai/soleur).
- **(b)** For data processed by GitHub as a platform, Users should refer to [GitHub's data subject request process](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

---

## 6. International Data Transfers

### 6.1 Local Data

No international data transfers are performed by Soleur with respect to Local Data.

### 6.2 Third-Party Transfers

When Users interact with third-party services (e.g., Anthropic Claude API, GitHub), data may be transferred internationally. These transfers are governed by the respective third-party's data processing agreements and transfer mechanisms. Users are responsible for ensuring adequate safeguards are in place for any such transfers.

### 6.3 Docs Site

The Docs Site is hosted on GitHub Pages, which may involve data processing in the United States and other jurisdictions where GitHub operates. GitHub maintains appropriate transfer mechanisms as described in its data processing agreements.

---

## 7. Data Breach Notification

### 7.1 Local Breaches

Soleur has no visibility into the User's local environment and therefore cannot detect or report data breaches affecting Local Data. Users are solely responsible for breach detection and notification obligations under Article 33 and Article 34 of the GDPR with respect to locally processed data.

### 7.2 Platform Breaches

In the unlikely event that a breach affects the Soleur GitHub repository, Docs Site, or distribution channels:

- **(a)** We will notify affected Users without undue delay, and in any event within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach, where feasible.
- **(b)** Notification will be provided via the [Soleur GitHub repository](https://github.com/jikig-ai/soleur) and, where possible, through direct communication.
- **(c)** The notification will include the nature of the breach, likely consequences, and measures taken or proposed to address it.

## 8. Future Cloud Features

### 8.1 Prospective Data Processing Changes

If Soleur introduces cloud-hosted features, server-side processing, or any functionality that involves the transmission of User data to Soleur-operated infrastructure:

- **(a)** This DPD will be updated to include full Article 28 GDPR-compliant data processing terms, including: subject matter, duration, nature and purpose of processing, types of Personal Data processed, and categories of data subjects.
- **(b)** Users will be notified of changes before any cloud processing begins.
- **(c)** Appropriate technical and organizational measures will be implemented in accordance with Article 32 of the GDPR.
- **(d)** A list of Sub-processors will be maintained and made available to Users.
- **(e)** Standard Contractual Clauses or other appropriate transfer mechanisms will be implemented for any international data transfers.
- **(f)** Data Processing Impact Assessments will be conducted where required under Article 35 of the GDPR.
- **(g)** Users will have the opportunity to review and accept updated terms before using any cloud features.

### 8.2 Notification of Changes

Any transition from local-only to cloud-assisted processing will be communicated:

- **(a)** At least 30 days before the change takes effect;
- **(b)** Via the Soleur GitHub repository, Docs Site, and release notes;
- **(c)** With a clear description of what data will be processed, for what purpose, and what safeguards are in place.

## 9. Audit Rights

### 9.1 Current Architecture

Given the local-only nature of the Plugin, traditional audit rights under Article 28(3)(h) of the GDPR are not applicable. However:

- **(a)** The Soleur Plugin source code is available for inspection on [GitHub](https://github.com/jikig-ai/soleur).
- **(b)** Users may verify that the Plugin does not transmit data by inspecting network activity during use.
- **(c)** Soleur welcomes security audits and responsible disclosure through the GitHub repository.

### 9.2 Future Cloud Features

If cloud features are introduced, full audit rights consistent with Article 28(3)(h) will be provided, including the right to conduct or commission audits and inspections.

---

## 10. Termination and Data Deletion

### 10.1 Plugin Removal

Users may uninstall the Plugin at any time. Upon removal:

- **(a)** All Local Data remains on the User's filesystem under their sole control.
- **(b)** Soleur does not retain any copy of Local Data, as no such data was ever transmitted to Soleur.
- **(c)** Users are responsible for deleting or retaining Local Data according to their own data retention policies.

### 10.2 Docs Site and Repository Data

Users who wish to have their data removed from the Soleur GitHub repository (e.g., issue comments, pull request contributions) should follow GitHub's standard data deletion procedures or contact us through the repository.
