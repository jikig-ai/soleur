**Effective Date:** February 20, 2026

This Disclaimer / Limitation of Liability ("Disclaimer") governs your use of Soleur, a Company-as-a-Service platform provided as a source-available Claude Code plugin (the "Platform," "Software," or "Service"), operated by Jikigai ("we," "us," or "our"). By accessing or using the Platform, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Disclaimer.

## 1. General Disclaimer

### 1.1 "As-Is" and "As-Available" Basis

THE PLATFORM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS-IS" AND "AS-AVAILABLE" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:

- **Implied warranties of merchantability** -- We make no warranty that the Platform is fit for commercial use or meets general quality expectations.
- **Fitness for a particular purpose** -- We make no warranty that the Platform will meet your specific requirements or achieve any particular outcome.
- **Non-infringement** -- We make no warranty that the Platform does not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of any third party.
- **Accuracy or reliability** -- We make no warranty that any output, content, or functionality provided by the Platform is accurate, reliable, complete, or error-free.
- **Uninterrupted or secure operation** -- We make no warranty that the Platform will operate without interruption, be free of defects, or be secure from unauthorized access.

### 1.2 Source-Available Software Disclaimer

Soleur is distributed as source-available software under the Business Source License 1.1 (BSL 1.1). The software is provided without charge for individual and internal company use and without obligation of support, maintenance, or updates. You use the Platform entirely at your own risk. The availability of the Platform as source-available software does not create any contractual, fiduciary, or professional relationship between you and us. Each version converts to the Apache License 2.0 four years after its publication date.

### 1.3 No Professional Advice

Nothing provided by or through the Platform -- including but not limited to AI-generated code, documents, plans, strategies, analyses, or recommendations -- constitutes professional advice of any kind (legal, financial, technical, business, or otherwise). You should not rely on Platform output as a substitute for professional consultation.

---

## 2. AI-Generated Output Disclaimer

### 2.1 Nature of AI-Generated Content

The Platform utilizes artificial intelligence agents to generate code, execute commands, create files, produce documents, develop plans, and automate workflows. All output produced by the Platform's AI agents ("AI-Generated Output") is:

- **Probabilistic, not deterministic** -- AI models generate output based on statistical patterns and may produce different results for the same input.
- **Potentially inaccurate or incomplete** -- AI-Generated Output may contain errors, omissions, inaccuracies, outdated information, or logical flaws.
- **Not a substitute for human judgment** -- AI-Generated Output requires human review, validation, and professional oversight before being used in any production, commercial, or consequential context.

### 2.2 AI-Generated Code Disclaimer

Code generated by Soleur's AI agents may:

- Contain bugs, security vulnerabilities, or performance issues;
- Not conform to your coding standards, regulatory requirements, or industry best practices;
- Introduce dependencies on third-party libraries with their own licensing terms;
- Produce unintended behavior when integrated into your systems;
- Execute commands or modify files on your local system.

**You are solely responsible for reviewing, testing, and validating all AI-generated code before deployment.** We strongly recommend thorough code review, automated testing, security auditing, and staging environment validation before using any AI-generated code in production.

### 2.3 AI-Generated Legal Documents Disclaimer

The Platform includes legal agents capable of generating draft legal documents, including but not limited to terms of service, privacy policies, and compliance documents. **These documents are drafts only and do not constitute legal advice.** Specifically:

- AI-generated legal documents are **not** prepared by licensed attorneys.
- AI-generated legal documents are **not** tailored to your specific legal circumstances, jurisdiction, or regulatory obligations.
- AI-generated legal documents **may not** comply with applicable laws, regulations, or legal requirements in your jurisdiction.
- AI-generated legal documents **require** review and approval by a qualified legal professional before use.
- Reliance on AI-generated legal documents without professional legal review is **entirely at your own risk**.

We expressly disclaim any responsibility for legal consequences arising from the use of AI-generated legal documents without independent legal counsel.

### 2.4 AI-Generated Plans and Strategies Disclaimer

Business plans, strategies, analyses, and recommendations produced by the Platform's AI agents are speculative in nature. They are not based on verified market data, financial auditing, or professional business consultation. You should not make business decisions based solely on AI-Generated Output.

## 3. Limitation of Liability

### 3.1 Exclusion of Damages

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL JIKIGAI, ITS CONTRIBUTORS, MAINTAINERS, AFFILIATES, OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY:

- **Direct damages** arising from your use of or inability to use the Platform;
- **Indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages**, including but not limited to loss of profits, loss of data, loss of business opportunity, loss of goodwill, or business interruption;
- **Damages arising from AI-Generated Output**, including but not limited to damages caused by errors in generated code, inaccurate legal documents, flawed business plans, or any other AI-generated content;
- **Damages arising from the execution of commands**, file modifications, or system changes performed by the Platform's AI agents on your local system;
- **Damages arising from third-party claims**, including intellectual property infringement claims related to AI-Generated Output;

WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

### 3.2 Aggregate Liability Cap

To the extent that any jurisdiction does not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability as set forth above, our total aggregate liability to you for all claims arising out of or related to your use of the Platform shall not exceed the amount you paid to us for the Platform in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim. **As the Platform is provided free of charge, this amount is zero (EUR 0.00 / USD $0.00).**

### 3.3 EU/EEA Consumer Protections

If you are a consumer located in the European Union or the European Economic Area, nothing in this Disclaimer shall limit or exclude our liability for:

- Death or personal injury caused by our negligence;
- Fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation;
- Any liability that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable EU or Member State law, including under the EU Consumer Rights Directive (2011/83/EU), the Digital Content Directive (2019/770/EU), or the Product Liability Directive;
- Any mandatory statutory rights that override contractual limitations.

Where EU law mandates a minimum level of conformity for digital content or digital services, such provisions shall apply notwithstanding any disclaimer in this document.

### 3.4 US State Law Protections

Some US states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or the limitation of incidental or consequential damages. If you reside in such a state, the above limitations and exclusions may not apply to you to the extent prohibited by applicable state law. In such cases, our liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.

## 4. Assumption of Risk

### 4.1 Local Execution Risk

The Platform operates locally on your system. AI agents may generate and execute commands, create, modify, or delete files, install dependencies, and interact with your development environment. **You acknowledge and accept the inherent risks of allowing AI-driven automation to operate on your local system**, including but not limited to:

- Unintended file modifications or deletions;
- Installation of unwanted or vulnerable software dependencies;
- Execution of commands with unintended side effects;
- Exposure of sensitive data through AI-generated code or configurations.

You are responsible for maintaining adequate backups and implementing appropriate safeguards (including version control, sandboxing, and access controls) to mitigate these risks.

### 4.2 No Guarantee of Results

We do not guarantee that the Platform will produce any particular result, save any particular amount of time, or provide any particular level of productivity improvement. Individual results depend on numerous factors outside our control, including your technical expertise, use case, system configuration, and the inherent limitations of AI technology.

---

## 5. Third-Party Services and Content

### 5.1 Third-Party Dependencies

The Platform may interact with or depend on third-party services, APIs, libraries, and tools (including but not limited to Anthropic's Claude API). We are not responsible for the availability, accuracy, or reliability of any third-party service, and we make no warranties regarding third-party content or functionality.

### 5.2 Third-Party Licensing

AI-Generated Output may include or reference code, libraries, or content subject to third-party licenses. You are responsible for identifying and complying with all applicable third-party license terms.

---

## 6. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Jikigai, its contributors, maintainers, and affiliates from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to:

- Your use of the Platform or any AI-Generated Output;
- Your violation of this Disclaimer or any applicable law;
- Your use of AI-generated legal documents without independent professional review;
- Any claim by a third party arising from your use of AI-Generated Output;
- Any harm caused by commands executed or files modified by the Platform on your system.

For EU/EEA Users, this indemnification obligation applies only to the extent permissible under applicable law and does not require you to indemnify us for losses caused by our own negligence or breach. Indemnification clauses that impose disproportionate burdens on consumers may be unenforceable under the Unfair Contract Terms Directive (93/13/EEC).

---

## 7. Severability

If any provision of this Disclaimer is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect the remaining provisions, which shall continue in full force and effect. The invalid provision shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable while preserving its original intent.

---

## 8. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

### 8.1 Governing Law

This Disclaimer shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of France, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.

### 8.2 Jurisdiction

Any disputes arising under or in connection with this Disclaimer shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Paris, France.

### 8.3 EU/EEA Consumers

If you are a consumer in the EU/EEA, nothing in this Disclaimer affects your rights under mandatory EU or member state consumer protection laws, including your right to bring proceedings in the courts of your country of habitual residence.
