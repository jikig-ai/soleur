**Last Updated:** February 21, 2026 (analytics disclosure)

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how Jikigai ("we," "us," or "our"), operator of Soleur, handles information in connection with the Soleur Company-as-a-Service platform ("the Plugin"), a Claude Code plugin providing agents, skills, commands, and a knowledge base for structured software development workflows, and the Soleur documentation website located at soleur.ai ("the Docs Site").

We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Policy explains what data is and is not collected, how the Plugin operates, and your rights under applicable law, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and US privacy regulations.

## 2. Who We Are

**Soleur** is a source-available project maintained by **Jikigai**, a company incorporated in France, with its registered office at 25 rue de Ponthieu, 75008 Paris, France. Jikigai is the data controller for the processing activities described in this Policy.

The Soleur source code is available at the GitHub repository [jikig-ai/soleur](https://github.com/jikig-ai/soleur).

For privacy inquiries, you may contact us at legal@jikigai.com (include "Privacy" in the subject line), by opening an issue on the GitHub repository, or through the website at [soleur.ai](https://soleur.ai).

## 3. What the Plugin Does

Soleur is a locally installed Claude Code plugin. It provides {{ stats.agents }} AI agents, {{ stats.skills }} skills, and a compounding knowledge base to support structured software development workflows. The Plugin is installed via the Claude Code CLI and runs entirely on your local machine.

## 4. Data We Collect

### 4.1 Data Collected by the Plugin: None

The Soleur Plugin **does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers**. Specifically:

- The Plugin runs entirely on your local machine.
- All knowledge-base files -- including plans, brainstorms, specifications, and learnings -- are stored exclusively on your local filesystem.
- The Plugin does not phone home, send telemetry, or transmit analytics to Jikigai-operated servers.
- The Plugin does not have its own backend, database, or cloud infrastructure.
- We do not have access to your files, your code, or your usage patterns.

### 4.2 Data Processed Locally

The Plugin creates and manages files on your local filesystem as part of its normal operation. These may include:

- **Knowledge-base files:** Plans, brainstorms, specs, learnings, and other structured documents stored in the `knowledge-base/` directory.
- **Configuration files:** Plugin settings and workflow state stored locally.
- **Git artifacts:** Branches, commits, and worktrees created as part of development workflows.

All of this data remains on your machine. We have no access to it.

### 4.3 Data Collected by the Docs Site

The Soleur documentation site at [soleur.ai](https://soleur.ai) is hosted on **GitHub Pages**. We use **Plausible Analytics** ([plausible.io](https://plausible.io)) for privacy-respecting website analytics. Plausible does not use cookies, local storage, or fingerprinting. It collects the following anonymous, aggregated data:

- Page URLs visited
- Referrer URLs (how visitors find the site)
- Country (derived from IP address, which is not stored)
- Device type (desktop, mobile, tablet)
- Browser and operating system

IP addresses are used only for country-level geolocation and are **not stored** by Plausible. No personally identifiable information is collected or retained by Plausible. The legal basis for this processing is **legitimate interest** (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR) -- understanding website traffic to improve documentation.

Additionally, GitHub, as the hosting provider, may collect certain technical data when you visit the Docs Site, including IP addresses, browser metadata, and page request data. This data collection is governed by [GitHub's Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement). We do not control or have direct access to data collected by GitHub.

### 4.4 Data Collected by the GitHub Repository

If you interact with the Soleur GitHub repository (e.g., opening issues, submitting pull requests, starring the repository), GitHub collects data in accordance with its own privacy policies. This is standard GitHub platform behavior and is not controlled by Soleur.

### 4.5 Data Collected Through the Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

If you contribute code to the Soleur project via pull requests, you are asked to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) through the CLA Assistant integrated into the GitHub repository. When you sign the CLA, the following data is collected and stored:

- **GitHub username** (used to identify the signer)
- **Timestamp** of signature
- **Pull request reference** associated with the signing event

This data is stored in the Soleur GitHub repository on a dedicated branch (`cla-signatures`) and is publicly visible. The legal basis for this processing is **legitimate interest** (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR) -- specifically, the legitimate interest of Jikigai in maintaining an enforceable record of contributor IP license grants to protect the integrity of the Soleur project's licensing framework.

**Retention:** CLA signature data is retained indefinitely because the license grants in the CLA are irrevocable and survive any withdrawal of the signature record. If you exercise your right to erasure under GDPR Article 17, your signature record may be deleted, but the license grants made under the CLA continue in full effect for all contributions made prior to deletion, as stated in the CLA itself.

## 5. Third-Party Services

### 5.1 Anthropic Claude API

The Soleur Plugin is designed to work with the Anthropic Claude API through the Claude Code CLI. When you use the Plugin:

- **You** connect to the Anthropic API using **your own API key**.
- Data sent to the Anthropic API (such as prompts, code context, and file contents) is transmitted directly between your machine and Anthropic's servers.
- Soleur does not intermediate, intercept, or store any data exchanged between you and Anthropic.
- Anthropic's handling of your data is governed by [Anthropic's Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy) and their Terms of Service.

### 5.2 GitHub

- The Plugin source code is hosted on GitHub.
- The Docs Site is hosted on GitHub Pages.
- GitHub's data practices are governed by [GitHub's Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

### 5.3 Other Third-Party Integrations

The Plugin may interact with other third-party tools and APIs as part of your development workflow (e.g., MCP servers, browser automation tools). These interactions are initiated by you, configured by you, and use your own credentials. Soleur does not control or monitor these interactions.

## 6. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR -- EU Users)

For users in the European Union or European Economic Area:

Because the Plugin itself does not collect or process personal data, no legal basis for processing is required for Plugin usage.

For the Docs Site, to the extent that technical data is collected by GitHub Pages, the legal basis is **legitimate interest** (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR) -- specifically, the legitimate interest in making documentation available to users via a standard web hosting service.

For website analytics via Plausible Analytics, the lawful basis is **legitimate interest** (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR) -- understanding documentation traffic patterns to improve content and user experience. This processing is cookie-free, stores no personal data, and does not require consent under the ePrivacy Directive (Article 5(3) does not apply as no information is stored on or accessed from the user's device).

If you interact with the GitHub repository (e.g., filing issues), the legal basis for processing your GitHub profile information in that context is **legitimate interest** (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR) -- facilitating community participation in the project. The balancing test for this interest considers: (a) the processing is limited to publicly available GitHub profile data voluntarily shared by the user, (b) the user initiated the interaction, (c) the processing is necessary for the stated purpose (community participation), and (d) the user can withdraw by deleting their GitHub contributions.

## 7. Data Retention

- **Plugin data:** All data created by the Plugin is stored locally on your machine. You control its retention and deletion entirely.
- **Docs Site data:** Any data collected by GitHub Pages is retained according to GitHub's data retention policies.
- **Repository interaction data:** Issues, pull requests, and other contributions are retained on GitHub according to its standard policies and your own account settings.

## 8. Your Rights

### 8.1 Rights Under GDPR (EU/EEA Users)

If you are located in the EU or EEA, you have the following rights with respect to any personal data processing:

- **Right of access** (Article 15) -- the right to obtain confirmation of whether personal data is being processed and access to that data.
- **Right to rectification** (Article 16) -- the right to correct inaccurate personal data.
- **Right to erasure** (Article 17) -- the right to request deletion of personal data ("right to be forgotten").
- **Right to restriction of processing** (Article 18) -- the right to limit how personal data is used.
- **Right to data portability** (Article 20) -- the right to receive personal data in a structured, machine-readable format.
- **Right to object** (Article 21) -- the right to object to processing based on legitimate interests.
- **Right to lodge a complaint** -- the right to file a complaint with your local Data Protection Authority.

Because the Plugin does not collect personal data, these rights are most relevant to your interactions with GitHub (the hosting platform). To exercise rights related to GitHub-collected data, contact GitHub directly through their privacy channels.

### 8.2 Rights Under US Privacy Laws

Users in the United States may have additional rights under state privacy laws (such as the California Consumer Privacy Act). Because Soleur does not collect personal information through the Plugin, these rights are primarily relevant to any data collected by GitHub as the hosting provider for the Docs Site and repository. Contact GitHub directly to exercise these rights.

## 9. Children's Privacy

The Soleur Plugin and Docs Site are not directed at children under the age of 16 (or 13 in jurisdictions where that threshold applies). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information through the GitHub repository, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.

## 10. International Data Transfers

The Plugin operates locally and does not transfer data internationally.

For the Docs Site and repository interactions, GitHub may transfer data internationally in accordance with its own policies and applicable data transfer mechanisms (such as Standard Contractual Clauses). See [GitHub's Global Privacy Practices](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#githubs-global-privacy-practices) for details.

When using the Anthropic Claude API, data may be transferred to Anthropic's servers in the United States. This transfer is governed by Anthropic's privacy policies and your agreement with Anthropic.

## 11. Security

Because the Plugin runs locally and does not transmit data to our servers, the security of Plugin-generated files depends on your local machine's security posture. We recommend:

- Keeping your operating system and development tools up to date.
- Using appropriate access controls on your local filesystem.
- Managing your API keys securely (e.g., not committing them to version control).
- Reviewing the Plugin's source code to verify its behavior.

## 12. Cookies

The Soleur Plugin does not use cookies.

The Docs Site, hosted on GitHub Pages, may use cookies as determined by GitHub's platform. Soleur does not add any first-party cookies to the Docs Site. For details on GitHub's cookie practices, see [GitHub's cookie documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-cookies).

## 13. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted to the GitHub repository and/or the Docs Site. The "Last Updated" date at the top of this document will be revised accordingly.

For material changes, we will make reasonable efforts to notify users (e.g., through a repository release note or a notice on the Docs Site).
