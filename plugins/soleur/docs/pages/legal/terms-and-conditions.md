**Soleur -- Company-as-a-Service Platform**

**Effective Date:** February 20, 2026

**Last Updated:** February 20, 2026

---

## 1. Introduction and Acceptance

These Terms & Conditions ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Soleur platform ("Soleur," "the Plugin," "the Service"), a Company-as-a-Service product developed and maintained by Soleur ("we," "us," "our"). Soleur is a Claude Code plugin that provides AI-powered agents, skills, commands, and a compounding knowledge base for structured software development workflows.

By installing, accessing, or using Soleur, you ("User," "you," "your") agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not install or use the Plugin.

These Terms apply to all Users globally, with specific provisions for Users in the European Union / European Economic Area (EU/EEA) under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Users in the United States.

## 2. Definitions

- **"Plugin"** refers to the Soleur Claude Code plugin, including all agents, skills, commands, configuration files, and knowledge-base components.
- **"Knowledge Base"** refers to the locally stored collection of brainstorms, plans, specs, learnings, and other artifacts generated during use.
- **"Documentation Site"** refers to the website hosted at soleur.ai on GitHub Pages.
- **"Third-Party Services"** refers to external services accessed through or in connection with the Plugin, including but not limited to the Anthropic Claude API, GitHub, and GitHub Pages.
- **"User Content"** refers to all data, files, configurations, and artifacts created, modified, or stored by the User through the Plugin.

## 3. Eligibility

You must be at least 18 years of age (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction) to use the Plugin. By using Soleur, you represent and warrant that you meet this requirement.

If you are using the Plugin on behalf of an organization, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms.

## 4. Description of the Service

Soleur is a locally installed Claude Code plugin that provides:

- **31 AI agents** organized across five domains (Engineering, Legal, Marketing, Operations, Product)
- **40 skills** for structured software development workflows
- A **compounding knowledge base** that stores project context locally
- **Commands** for orchestrating development workflows (brainstorm, plan, review, work, ship)

### 4.1 Local-First Architecture

The Plugin is installed and operates locally on your machine via the Claude Code CLI. All knowledge-base files, configuration data, and User Content are stored exclusively on your local file system. Soleur does not operate cloud servers and does not collect, transmit, or store your data on remote infrastructure controlled by us.

### 4.2 Third-Party API Interactions

The Plugin facilitates interactions with the Anthropic Claude API and other third-party services. These interactions occur through your own API keys and accounts. You are solely responsible for:

- Maintaining the security of your API keys and credentials
- Complying with the terms of service of all third-party providers
- Any costs or charges incurred through third-party API usage

## 5. License and Intellectual Property

### 5.1 License Grant

Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to install and use the Plugin for your personal or internal business purposes.

### 5.2 Restrictions

You shall not:

- Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Plugin except as expressly permitted by applicable law (including EU Directive 2009/24/EC on the legal protection of computer programs)
- Remove, alter, or obscure any proprietary notices, labels, or marks
- Use the Plugin to develop a competing product or service
- Sublicense, sell, rent, lease, or otherwise commercially distribute the Plugin without prior written consent
- Use the Plugin in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations

### 5.3 User Content Ownership

You retain all rights, title, and interest in your User Content. We claim no ownership over any files, knowledge-base entries, code, or artifacts generated or stored on your local machine through use of the Plugin.

### 5.4 Our Intellectual Property

All rights, title, and interest in and to the Plugin (including agent definitions, skill configurations, command logic, and documentation) remain with us. These Terms do not grant you any rights to our trademarks, service marks, or trade names.

## 6. AI-Generated Output

### 6.1 Nature of AI Output

Soleur leverages AI models to generate code, documentation, legal document drafts, plans, reviews, and other content. All AI-generated output is provided on an "as-is" basis and:

- May contain errors, inaccuracies, or omissions
- Does not constitute professional advice (legal, financial, technical, or otherwise)
- Requires human review and validation before use in production or business-critical contexts

### 6.2 Legal Document Generation

The Plugin includes a legal document generation capability. Documents generated by this feature are explicitly marked as drafts requiring professional legal review. These generated documents do not constitute legal advice and should not be relied upon without review by a qualified legal professional.

### 6.3 Responsibility for Output

You are solely responsible for reviewing, validating, and assuming liability for any AI-generated output you choose to use, publish, deploy, or distribute.

## 7. Data Practices and Privacy

### 7.1 Local Data Storage

Soleur operates on a local-first model. The Plugin itself does not collect, transmit, or store personal data on external servers. All User Content, configuration files, and knowledge-base entries remain on your local machine under your control.

### 7.2 Documentation Site

The Soleur documentation site (soleur.ai) is hosted on GitHub Pages. GitHub, as the hosting provider, may collect certain data such as IP addresses and browser metadata in accordance with GitHub's own privacy practices. We do not control GitHub's data collection. Please refer to GitHub's Privacy Statement for details.

### 7.3 Third-Party Data Processing

When the Plugin facilitates interactions with the Anthropic Claude API or other third-party services, data transmitted to those services is governed by their respective privacy policies and terms of service. We are not responsible for the data practices of third-party service providers.

### 7.4 EU/EEA Users -- GDPR Rights

If you are located in the EU/EEA, you have rights under the GDPR including the right of access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, data portability, and objection. Because Soleur stores data locally and does not collect personal data on our servers, these rights are inherently satisfied by your local control over the data. For any GDPR-related inquiries concerning the documentation site or third-party integrations, please contact us through the channels listed in Section 16.

## 8. Acceptable Use

You agree to use the Plugin only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. You shall not use the Plugin to:

- Violate any applicable local, national, or international law or regulation
- Generate, store, or distribute content that is illegal, harmful, threatening, abusive, defamatory, or otherwise objectionable
- Infringe on the intellectual property rights of any third party
- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to systems, networks, or data
- Introduce malware, viruses, or other harmful code
- Circumvent, disable, or interfere with security features of the Plugin or connected services
- Use the Plugin for automated decision-making that produces legal effects on individuals without appropriate human oversight, as required under GDPR Article 22

## 9. Disclaimer of Warranties

### 9.1 "As Is" Provision

THE PLUGIN IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ACCURACY.

### 9.2 No Guarantee of Availability or Accuracy

We do not warrant that the Plugin will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or free of harmful components. We do not warrant the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of any output generated by the Plugin's AI capabilities.

### 9.3 EU Consumer Rights

Nothing in this section limits or excludes any warranty rights that you may have under mandatory applicable law, including EU consumer protection legislation. If you are a consumer in the EU/EEA, you benefit from mandatory statutory warranty rights that cannot be waived or limited by contract.

## 10. Limitation of Liability

### 10.1 General Limitation

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE PLUGIN.

### 10.2 Aggregate Liability Cap

OUR TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR YOUR USE OF THE PLUGIN SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US (IF ANY) IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.

### 10.3 EU/EEA Limitations

For Users in the EU/EEA, the limitations in this section apply only to the extent permitted by applicable law. Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits liability for:

- Death or personal injury caused by negligence
- Fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation
- Any liability that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable EU or member state law

## 11. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Soleur and its affiliates, contributors, and licensors from and against any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to:

- Your use of the Plugin
- Your violation of these Terms
- Your violation of any applicable law or regulation
- Your User Content
- Your use or misuse of AI-generated output

For EU/EEA Users, this indemnification obligation applies only to the extent permissible under applicable law and does not require you to indemnify us for losses caused by our own negligence or breach.

## 12. Modifications to the Terms

We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Changes will be posted to the Soleur GitHub repository (jikig-ai/soleur) and/or the documentation site (soleur.ai). Material changes will be communicated through the repository's release notes or changelog.

Your continued use of the Plugin after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the modified Terms. If you do not agree to the modified Terms, you must stop using the Plugin.

For EU/EEA Users, we will provide reasonable advance notice of material changes (at least 30 days where practicable) and you may terminate your use of the Plugin if you do not accept the modified Terms.

## 13. Termination

### 13.1 Termination by You

You may stop using the Plugin at any time by uninstalling it from your Claude Code environment. No notice to us is required.

### 13.2 Termination by Us

We may suspend or terminate your right to use the Plugin for cause, including but not limited to violation of these Terms. For EU/EEA Users, we will provide at least 30 days' notice before termination takes effect, except where termination is necessitated by a legal obligation or where the User has repeatedly or materially breached these Terms.

### 13.3 Effect of Termination

Upon termination, your license to use the Plugin ceases. Because all data is stored locally on your machine, termination does not affect your User Content -- you retain full control of your local files.

Sections 5.4, 6, 9, 10, 11, 14, and 15 survive termination.

## 14. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

### 14.1 For US Users

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any disputes arising under these Terms shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in Delaware.

### 14.2 For EU/EEA Users

If you are a consumer in the EU/EEA, these Terms shall be governed by the laws of your country of residence, and you may bring proceedings in the courts of your country of residence. Nothing in these Terms affects your rights as a consumer under mandatory EU or member state consumer protection laws.

The European Commission provides an Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) platform at https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr. We are not obligated to participate in ODR procedures but will consider doing so on a case-by-case basis.

### 14.3 For All Other Users

For Users outside the US and EU/EEA, these Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, United States, unless mandatory local law requires otherwise.

## 15. General Provisions

### 15.1 Entire Agreement

These Terms, together with any referenced policies (including our Privacy Policy and Acceptable Use Policy), constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding your use of the Plugin.

### 15.2 Severability

If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

### 15.3 Waiver

Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.

### 15.4 Assignment

You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights hereunder without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms without restriction.

### 15.5 Force Majeure

We shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performance resulting from causes beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to natural disasters, war, terrorism, pandemics, government actions, or failures of third-party services.

### 15.6 No Third-Party Beneficiaries

These Terms do not confer any rights on any third party unless expressly stated.
