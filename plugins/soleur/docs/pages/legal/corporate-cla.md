Thank you for your organization's interest in contributing to the Soleur project ("Project"), maintained by Jikigai ("We" or "Us"), a company incorporated in France with its registered office at 25 rue de Ponthieu, 75008 Paris, France.

This Corporate Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") defines the terms under which Contributions are submitted to the Project on behalf of the signing organization. By signing this Agreement, the organization ("You" or "Your") accepts and agrees to the following terms and conditions for present and future Contributions submitted to the Project by Your employees, contractors, or other authorized representatives.

## 1. Definitions

- **"You" (or "Your")** means the organization that is entering into this Agreement, and all entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that organization. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

- **"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by any of Your authorized representatives to the Project for inclusion in, or documentation of, the Project. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Project or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Project, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

- **"Authorized Representative"** means an individual authorized by You to submit Contributions on Your behalf. You must maintain a current list of Authorized Representatives and communicate changes to Us.

## 2. Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Us and to recipients of software distributed by Us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Contributions submitted by Your Authorized Representatives and such derivative works. You further grant to Us the right to sublicense these rights through multiple tiers of sublicensees, and the right to relicense such Contributions under any license terms selected by Us, including proprietary and commercial license terms.

## 3. Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Us and to recipients of software distributed by Us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer Contributions submitted by Your Authorized Representatives, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by such Contribution(s) alone or by combination of such Contribution(s) with the Project to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.

This patent license grant does not extend to patents that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the Project after the Contribution is incorporated.

**Note regarding moral rights:** In jurisdictions where moral rights (such as droits moraux under French law) are inalienable and cannot be waived, this Agreement does not require the waiver of such rights. Your Authorized Representatives agree, through Your signing of this Agreement, not to assert any moral rights in a way that would impede the exercise of the licenses granted herein, to the extent permitted by applicable law.

## 4. Representations

You represent that:

(a) You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses. You represent that each Authorized Representative is authorized to submit Contributions on Your behalf.

(b) Each Contribution submitted by Your Authorized Representatives is an original creation that You own or have sufficient rights to submit under the terms of this Agreement.

(c) You have identified all Authorized Representatives who may submit Contributions on Your behalf by providing a list of GitHub usernames to Us.

(d) Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which You or Your Authorized Representatives are aware and which are associated with any part of the Contributions.

(e) You understand that the Project and the Contributions are public, and that a record of each Contribution (including all personal information associated with it, such as GitHub usernames) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with this Agreement and the license(s) involved.

## 5. Authorized Representative Management

You are responsible for maintaining an accurate list of Authorized Representatives. To add or remove Authorized Representatives, contact Us at legal@jikigai.com. Until We are notified of a change, the most recent list of Authorized Representatives on file shall apply.

## 6. Support and Warranty Disclaimer

You are not expected to provide support for Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Contributions are provided on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

## 7. Notification

You agree to notify Us of any facts or circumstances of which You become aware that would make the representations in this Agreement inaccurate in any respect.

## 8. Miscellaneous

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of France, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Any disputes arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Paris, France.

(b) This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement between You and Us regarding Contributions made on Your behalf to the Project and supersedes all prior agreements, negotiations, and discussions between the parties relating thereto.

(c) If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

(d) A waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of any other provision, and any failure to enforce any provision shall not constitute a waiver of future enforcement.

(e) The license grants in Sections 2 and 3 of this Agreement are irrevocable and survive termination of this Agreement. If You later request deletion of signature records (for example, under GDPR), the license grants made under this Agreement continue in full effect for all Contributions made prior to such deletion.
