Read and follow the instructions in ${GROK_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/engineering/cto.md.

In that file, a multi-segment `soleur:<domain>:<name>` id names an agent: spawn it with spawn_subagent using the id with its colons replaced by hyphens. A one-segment `soleur:<name>` names a skill: Read `${GROK_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
