# Drift guard for #6992: no policy-gate hook may feed a producer into `grep -q`
# through a pipe.
#
# Under `set -o pipefail` that shape reports FAILURE on a SUCCESSFUL match once
# the producer still has unwritten data when grep exits — and because these
# hooks are shaped `<match> && deny` or `if ! <match>; then <skip>`, the
# dominant failure direction is FAIL OPEN: the gate silently permits what it
# exists to block. Measured at 0 denies in 30 runs on a 128 KB plan body whose
# first line was an operator-SSH step.
#
# Use instead:
#   grep -q PATTERN <<<"$var"                              # no pipe, no SIGPIPE
#   [ "$(producer | grep -c PATTERN || true)" -gt 0 ]      # -c reads all input
#
# Scope note: this asserts ZERO, not "no growth beyond a baseline". A baseline
# allowlist that grandfathers existing entries asserts nothing on day one. The
# hooks tree was taken to zero in #6992, so zero is the enforceable invariant.
#
# #7024 added the two files it took to zero, so they cannot regress:
#   tests/scripts/test-sentry-full-root-apply.sh
#   plugins/soleur/skills/compound/test/phase-16.test.sh
# #8664 added the zot-pull mutation battery and the guard it mutates:
#   apps/web-platform/infra/cloud-init-inngest-zot-pull-mutation.test.sh
#   apps/web-platform/infra/cloud-init-inngest-bootstrap.test.sh
# #8855 added the shared row scorer and five batteries that route their verdicts through it
# (FILES_8855 below; zot-pull, the sixth consumer, stays in FILES_8664). #8763 had rewritten four
# of those infra batteries' scorers from `| grep -qF --` to `| grep -cF --`, which PATTERN does not
# see, so both passes also run PATTERN_PIPED_SCORER — otherwise a revert to that spelling passes.
# This is a LINE search: a scorer with no `--`, a long first flag, a `command`/`\grep` wrapper or a
# pipe split across lines is not seen (widening tracked in #7005). What pins the WIRE is
# apps/web-platform/infra/lib/mutation-scorer-consumers.test.sh, which requires every battery that
# sources the lib to actually reach it.
# #7376 added three infra/plugin suites whose 2026-10-05 CI flakes were this same mechanism (FILES_7376):
#   apps/web-platform/infra/cron-egress-firewall.test.sh
#   apps/web-platform/infra/workspaces-luks-verify-workflow.test.sh
#   plugins/soleur/skills/git-worktree/test/reap-archive-persistence.test.sh
# THE PRODUCER'S SIZE IS NOT A BOUND ON THE RACE. It was believed to need more than a 64 KiB pipe buffer
# (#7005, #7432); it fires with a 3-line `git log` producer (the reap suite) and with an `echo` of a
# few KB (the cron census logged `echo: write error: Broken pipe`), because the writer only has to be
# unfinished when the reader exits. Under an ignored SIGPIPE (CI) it surfaces as rc 1 instead of 141.
# The luks suite's real mechanism is the OTHER end of the pipe — a stub that never reads stdin makes
# the workflow's own `printf | ssh` take the signal — which no line search sees; the late-producer and
# non-draining-stub rows in that suite hold it. The runtime SIGPIPE control for this class lives in
# tests/scripts/test-sentry-full-root-apply.sh (T4: `yes | grep -q y`, the `type -t grep` shim guard).
# The REST of scripts/ and plugins/ is still out of scope — ~800 sites repo-wide,
# tracked in #7005. #7024 was a slice of that corpus, not a peer of it.
#
# THE PATHSPEC CANNOT SIMPLY BE WIDENED TO scripts/ OR plugins/. This pattern matches
# COMMENTS as well as code — it is a text search, not a parse — so a wider sweep starts
# matching prose that merely NAMES the forbidden shape, including this file's own
# non-vacuity probe below and the learning file that documents the bug. Zero is
# enforceable here precisely because the pathspec is narrow and each member was taken to
# zero deliberately. Growth happens by adding a named file, never by widening a glob.

#
# TWO FILTERS, AND BOTH ARE THE SAME LESSON THIS GUARD IS ABOUT.
#
#   1. COMMENT LINES ARE STRIPPED. The pattern is a text search, so it matches prose that
#      merely NAMES the shape — and these two files necessarily document it at length. The
#      sibling `_strip_comments` in test-sentry-full-root-apply.sh exists for exactly this

#      on a token a comment can also produce. Written without this, the guard false-FAILs
#      on the very explanation of the bug it enforces.
#
#   2. AN EXPLICIT PER-LINE OPT-OUT. test-sentry-full-root-apply.sh's T4 arm has to USE the
#      forbidden shape: it is the synthetic reproduction of the SIGPIPE mechanism, plus the
#      `yes | grep -q y` positive control that proves the environment can exhibit SIGPIPE
#      at all. A test that demonstrates a bug must be allowed to contain it. The marker is
#      per-LINE and must be typed out, so it cannot be applied by accident or by a glob.
