# PreToolUse hook for Write, Edit, MultiEdit, NotebookEdit, and Bash.
# ADVISORY guard: surfaces a one-time `ask` when a write would introduce a NEW
# top-level entry under `knowledge-base/` that is NOT in the sanctioned domain
# set.
#
# Source request: keep knowledge-base/ to its documented domain + project
# directories. A stray top-level dir (e.g. an accidental `security/` that only
# holds a placeholder) renders as an anomalous entry in the GitHub/web file
# browser and fragments the domain taxonomy. This guard makes a new top-level
# segment an explicit, operator-acknowledged decision rather than a silent one.
#
# Decision tier = `ask` (NOT `deny`, NOT silent `allow`): adding a new top-level
# domain is a legitimate-but-rare operation (see plugins/soleur/AGENTS.md
# "Adding a New Domain"). A hard deny would break that flow; a silent allow
# defeats the guard. `ask` surfaces it for one operator confirmation, then the
# segment exists on disk and subsequent writes pass cleanly.
#
# Fires ONLY on a NEW top-level segment (not already on disk and not sanctioned).
# Writing INTO an existing sanctioned domain (engineering/, project/, ...) or to
# a sanctioned top-level file (INDEX.md, ...) always passes.
#
# Coverage mirrors no-memory-write.sh: file tools check file_path/notebook_path
# (an unambiguous write target). Bash checks the command string for a
# knowledge-base/<segment> substring, but ONLY treats it as guard-worthy when the
# command actually WRITES to that path — a positive write-VERB / kb-targeted-
# REDIRECT allowlist (`mkdir`/`touch`/`tee`/`cat >`/`mv`/`cp`/`git add`/…). A
# read-only reference that merely MENTIONS a kb path (`git show <ref>:path`,
# `git ls-tree`, `grep`, `cat`) carries no write verb and no kb-targeted redirect,
# so it passes cleanly instead of firing a spurious `ask`. Adversarial evasion
# (eval, base64) AND exotic write forms are out of scope — this gate exists for
# accidental taxonomy drift, not bypass-defeat.

# Bash write-target gate (read-vs-write distinction). For the Bash class only,

# when the command actually WRITES to it. A read reference (`git show
# <ref>:knowledge-base/...`, `git ls-tree`, `grep`, `cat`, `gh ... view`) merely
# MENTIONS the path — the Bash coverage exists to catch accidental taxonomy-drift
# WRITES (mkdir/cat >/mv/tee), not reads. A Bash read that passes this gate
# `exit 0`s HERE; it does not need the downstream checks (glob-guard /
# sanctioned-dir / sanctioned-file / on-disk) — those are ALL pass-through
# branches a read never required. Only a Bash *write* fails this gate and falls
# through to the existing logic unchanged, so the gate can NEVER convert a pass
# into an `ask` nor remove the existing `ask`. File-tool payloads skip the gate
# entirely (IS_BASH unset) and reach the existing logic with current behavior
# preserved. Note: this runs BEFORE the glob-guard below — the glob-guard is
# simply not exercised for Bash reads (they exit here first).

# Detection is a positive write-VERB / kb-targeted-REDIRECT allowlist. Per the
# header philosophy (adversarial evasion + exotic write forms out of scope), this
# need not be exhaustive — it covers every write a human/agent realistically uses
# to create a new top-level kb entry, mirroring the verb family in
# no-memory-write.sh.
#   - KB_WRITE_VERB_RE: a write verb followed — WITHIN ONE pipeline/command
#     segment (`[^|;&<newline>]*`) — by a knowledge-base/ path. The segment bound
#     stops a verb in stage-1 from matching a kb READ in a later stage/line
#     (`... | grep ... ; cat knowledge-base/x`, or a verb on line 1 + a kb read on
#     line 3). The newline is part of the exclusion class (via `$'...'` so `\n` is
#     a literal newline char) — a multi-line command does not let a stage-1 verb
#     reach a later-line kb read.
#   - KB_WRITE_REDIR_RE: a `>`/`>>` redirect whose target is a knowledge-base/
#     path. It anchors the literal `knowledge-base/` immediately after the
#     `>`/spaces/optional-quote, so `>/dev/null 2>&1` (present in the repro) does
#     NOT match — a naive `>`-presence check would re-introduce the false positive.
# Both regexes MUST be assigned to variables before `[[ =~ ]]`: an inline literal
# containing `;`/`&`/`|` triggers a bash conditional-expression parse error.
