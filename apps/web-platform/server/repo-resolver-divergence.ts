// is queryable by fingerprint (no SSH). The Sentry issue-alert ROUTING rule is a

/**
 * Emit a fingerprint-deduped `agent_readiness_self_stop` event (#5733 Phase 1b).
 *
 * The `/soleur:go` Step 0.0 readiness self-stop is PROMPT-DRIVEN — the agent
 * reasons over prompt text and stops, emitting NO server-side Sentry event
 * (the deepest reason all three prior server-side fixes left "zero events on
 * the agent surface"). This makes the strand observable by emitting a
 * server-side signal at the dispatch readiness gate the moment the gate detects
 * a `.git` shape that WOULD strand the agent's in-bwrap `git rev-parse` (a stale
 * gitdir-pointer FILE / structurally-invalid tree), BEFORE the self-heal runs —
 * so the strand is queryable and H2 is confirmed retroactively on the same
 * dispatch.
 *
 * QUERY-ONLY BY DESIGN: the strand auto-heals in the SAME dispatch (the stale
 * pointer is unlinked + re-cloned before `query()`), so this is a *discoverability*
 * signal (the plan's `jq length` post-deploy check), not a page — it deliberately
 * gets no `sentry_issue_alert` rule. `reportSilentFallback` still `captureException`s
 * it, so it is queryable in Sentry.
 *
 * DISTINCT `Error` message → its OWN Sentry issue group (NOT the shared
 * `repo_resolver_divergence` group), so the discoverability query counts it
 * independently.
 *
 * PSEUDONYMIZATION (ADR-029, security #5733): `userId` is renamed to `userIdHash`
 * at the `reportSilentFallback` boundary. CRITICAL — for a SOLO workspace
 * `workspace_id == user_id`, so the active-workspace id IS the raw userId; it is
 * pre-hashed here to `activeWorkspaceIdHash` and the raw `workspacePath`
 * (`<root>/<id>`) is NOT emitted, so the rename-at-boundary is not defeated by a
 * sibling field. `extra` carries NO `installationId`/`repoUrl` (credential-grant
 * identifiers) and NO raw `gitdirTarget` (only the `gitKind` + escape boolean).
