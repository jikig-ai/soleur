 * reclaim the dir can be gone — and dir-existence is a STRONGER precondition
 * than clone-eligibility: `ensureWorkspaceRepoCloned` early-returns for
 * not-connected (no `installationId`/`repoUrl`) and `.git`-present workspaces
 * BEFORE it ever reaches `realGraftRepoClone`'s own mkdir, so a reclaimed
 * not-connected (or `.git`-present-but-root-deleted) workspace would otherwise
 * get NO dir re-creation and the sandbox builds against a non-existent CWD
 * (the "configured CWD `/workspaces/<uuid>` doesn't exist" symptom). This mkdir
 * is therefore UNCONDITIONAL and independent of the clone (PR #5367's conditional
 * mkdir stays — it is correct for the clone; this is the wider precondition).
 *
 * Fail-soft-but-loud (per the not-connected fail-soft hazard): one bounded retry,
 * then mirror to Sentry (`cq-silent-fallback-must-mirror-to-sentry`) and THROW.
 * It must NOT silently proceed to construct a sandbox against a still-missing dir
 * — for the not-connected case there is no clone to recover and no clone-`"failed"`
 * to surface the honest "workspace reclaimed" message, so silent-proceed would
 * reconstruct the exact original symptom with only a swallowed Sentry event. The
 * throw rides the caller's existing `query()`-construction catch, which surfaces
 * the retryable error envelope to the conversation.
 *
 * Creates ONLY the workspace root (`recursive: true`), never `.git` — so the
 * clone's `.git`-absent no-op guard and `"failed"` honest-message path are
 * unperturbed. Recursive mkdir on an existing dir is idempotent.
