# (#6982, W12 rung 1) RUNTIME rehearsal of the git-data runcmd chain, in the pinned
# Ubuntu 24.04 image, against a real capture endpoint.
#
# WHY A RUNTIME TEST WHEN THE STATIC GUARDS ALREADY PASS. Every other gate in #6982 is
# static, and the failure class it defends against — "green apply, dark host" — is only
# observable when the code RUNS. The Phase-0 W0 probe is the proof: a config-scope mismatch
# that passed `terraform validate`, every drift-guard and every mutation arm, and would
# have died silently on first boot. Mutation arms prove the code CAN go red when neutered;
# they never prove the right thing happens when it is intact.
#
# WHAT THIS RUNG CANNOT ANSWER, stated so a green run is not over-read: it does not
# exercise `doppler run` against real Doppler, `luksOpen` against a real volume, the
# private NIC, or whether an event reaches Sentry/Better Stack. Those need the throwaway-
# host rung, which is the banner-clear issue's precondition (#7025) — NOT this file's.
#
# Run: bash apps/web-platform/infra/git-data-runcmd-rehearsal.test.sh
# Registered as a step in .github/workflows/infra-validation.yml.
