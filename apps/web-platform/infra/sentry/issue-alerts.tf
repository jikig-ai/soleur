# Issue alerts for the auth observability stack — operator-keyed names that
# match apps/web-platform/scripts/configure-sentry-alerts.sh byte-for-byte
# per knowledge-base/project/learnings/2026-05-13-helper-migration-must-
# preserve-operator-dashboard-message-strings.md.
#
# IMPORT-ONLY: these resources mirror existing Sentry rules created by the
# legacy script. Operator runs `terraform import sentry_issue_alert.<name>
# <org>/<project>/<rule-id>` BEFORE the first apply (see README.md). Match
# by id, never by name (Sentry API allows duplicate names — see
# 2026-04-29-supabase-auth-probe-and-sentry-rule-api-quirks.md).
#
# Lifecycle ignore_changes covers the v2 attribute set + environment +
# frequency, all of which can recompute on import for the legacy rules per
# the v0.15 release notes (Kieran P1, plan §5).
