# Cron monitors for the 8 currently-scheduled GitHub Actions workflows that
# touch secrets. Closes #3236 (vendor-hosted dead-man's-switch). The plan
# enumerated 9 workflows; `scheduled-cf-token-expiry-check` is deferred
# this cycle (its `schedule:` block is commented out — see the
# breadcrumb-only resource gap at lines 50-56). Re-introduce a 9th
# resource when that workflow's schedule lands.
#
# Sentry derives the monitor slug
# from `name` (slugified); we use the workflow filename without `.yml` so
# the slug matches the MONITOR_SLUG env var in each workflow's check-in
# steps (Phase 4).
#
# AUTO-CREATED on push to main via .github/workflows/apply-sentry-infra.yml
# (Phase 5.5) — this closes the window between Phase 4 check-in steps
# shipping and the monitors existing in Sentry.
#
# Per-workflow grace periods (checkin_margin_minutes / max_runtime_minutes)
# come from observed run history. TBD entries fall back to 60/15 defaults
# until the operator captures real medians via `gh run list`.
#
# All monitors use UTC timezone — workflow cron expressions are UTC by GHA
# convention.
#
# `failure_issue_threshold` default is 1 (single missed check-in opens an
# issue). The two exceptions (oauth-probe and github-app-drift-guard, set
# to 2) fire every 15 minutes / every hour respectively, where a single
# transient network hiccup is more likely than a real failure — requiring
# two consecutive misses raises the noise floor without losing the signal.
# All other monitors fire daily/weekly where a single miss is itself
# noteworthy.

# false-positive page every Monday. Re-introduce this resource when the
