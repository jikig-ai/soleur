/**
 * Per-doc SHA-256 literals for the 8 non-T&C legal documents under
 * `docs/legal/`. These are drift-detection constants ONLY — they are NOT
 * persisted to any audit ledger and have no runtime consumer.
 *
 * T&C exception: `terms-and-conditions.md` keeps its SHA in
 * `apps/web-platform/lib/legal/tc-version.ts` as `TC_DOCUMENT_SHA` because
 * that literal is load-bearing — it is consumed at
 * `app/api/accept-terms/route.ts` (`p_doc_sha` argument to the
 * `accept_terms` RPC) and written into the `public.tc_acceptances` WORM
 * ledger. Mixing the audit-evidence literal with drift-only literals
 * obscures the reader's mental model of which constants gate consent.
 *
 * Drift-only role: each SHA must equal `sha256sum docs/legal/<key>.md` of
 * the canonical doc at the time of the most recent edit. The CI guard
 * (`.github/workflows/ci.yml :: tc-document-sha-guard`, script at
 * `apps/web-platform/scripts/check-tc-document-sha.sh`) asserts equality
 * and fails the build on mismatch. Unlike T&C, there is NO `TC_VERSION`-
 * style bump bypass for these docs — every canonical edit MUST be paired
 * with a refresh of the corresponding SHA literal here. The 8 docs are
 * notice/disclosure documents and not contracts of adhesion; no
 * middleware reads a version constant for them.
 *
 * Bump-policy rubric (Tier 1 / Tier 2 / Tier 3 classification still
 * applies for Article 30 register + counsel-review-ledger purposes):
 * `knowledge-base/legal/tc-version-bump-policy.md` (§ Non-T&C legal docs).
