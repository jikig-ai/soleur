# Marketing Audit -- Brand Consistency, GitHub Alignment, Website Improvements

## Overview

Fix brand voice violations across all public-facing surfaces, restructure the root README, align GitHub metadata, update stale component counts, and improve the website. All text changes, one PR.

## Problem Statement

Brand voice violations exist across 10+ files. The root README conflates vision with product docs. GitHub metadata is incomplete (no homepage URL, hedging description). Component counts are stale in the brand guide (31/40 vs actual 45/45) and legal docs. The getting-started page lacks context for cold visitors.

## Checklist

1. Brand guide: update 31/40 -> 45/45 counts and tone spectrum example
2. Grep for all prohibited terms across public-facing files, fix all hits
3. Add "plugin" boundary exception rule to brand guide Voice section
4. Update stale counts in all 7 legal documents (31/40 -> 45/45)
5. Fix changelog.njk ("Soleur plugin" -> "Soleur")
6. Restructure root README: remove vision section, remove table of contents, add website badge, add "Learn More" links, rewrite opening as declarative brand statement
7. Create /vision page from moved README content, rewritten in brand voice
8. Add "Why Soleur" section to getting-started page before install command
9. Fix index.njk line 105 ("AI-powered" -> remove)
10. Fix llms.txt.njk ("Claude Code plugin" -> "Company-as-a-Service platform")
11. Fix help.md ("AI-powered development workflow" -> "The Company-as-a-Service Platform")
12. Fix overview/README.md ("Claude Code plugin providing AI-powered development tools")
13. `gh repo edit`: set homepage to soleur.ai, update description, optimize topics
14. Update plugin.json homepage to soleur.ai
15. Run local Eleventy build to verify no breakage
16. Create analytics research issue, comment on #188 with deferral context

## Detailed Notes

### Brand voice violations (items 2, 9-12)

Known violations to fix:

| File | Current | Fix |
|------|---------|-----|
| `README.md` lines 1, 25 | "Soleur is meant to be..." | "Soleur is the Company-as-a-Service platform..." |
| `README.md` line 27 | "AI-powered company orchestration" | Rewrite without prohibited term |
| `README.md` line 71 | "By leveraging synthetic labor" | "Using synthetic labor" or rewrite |
| `plugins/soleur/docs/index.njk` line 105 | "AI-powered support that resolves..." | "Support that resolves problems before they escalate." |
| `plugins/soleur/docs/llms.txt.njk` line 9 | "a Claude Code plugin providing" | "a Company-as-a-Service platform with" |
| `plugins/soleur/commands/soleur/help.md` | "Soleur - AI-powered development workflow" | "Soleur - The Company-as-a-Service Platform" |
| `knowledge-base/overview/README.md` line 3 | "Claude Code plugin providing AI-powered development tools" | "Company-as-a-Service platform providing development tools" |
| `plugins/soleur/docs/pages/changelog.njk` line 3 | "All notable changes to the Soleur plugin." | "All notable changes to Soleur." |

Run verification grep after all fixes to ensure zero remaining violations.

### "plugin" boundary rule (item 3)

Add to brand guide Voice > Do's and Don'ts:

> **Exception:** The word "plugin" is permitted in literal CLI commands (`claude plugin install`), in legal documents where "Plugin" is a defined term, and in technical documentation describing the installation mechanism. It is prohibited when describing Soleur's identity.

### Root README restructure (item 6)

Changes:
- **Remove:** Lines 65-106 (entire vision section), table of contents
- **Add:** Website badge (gold, links to soleur.ai), "Learn More" section with links to website pages
- **Rewrite:** Opening line and "What is Soleur?" section in declarative brand voice
- **Keep:** Installation, Workflow, Community, Contributing, Credits, License unchanged

### /vision page (item 7)

Create `plugins/soleur/docs/pages/vision.njk`:
- Content from README lines 65-106, rewritten in brand voice (remove "leverage", hedging)
- Proper frontmatter (title, description, layout, permalink)
- Add to `site.json` nav (after "Community") and footerLinks

### GitHub metadata (item 13)

```bash
gh repo edit --homepage "https://soleur.ai"
gh repo edit --description "The Company-as-a-Service platform. 45 AI agents, 45 skills, 8 commands. Build, ship, and scale -- powered by AI teams."
gh repo edit --add-topic claude --add-topic ai-agents --add-topic developer-tools --add-topic automation --add-topic code-review
```

Consider replacing `claude-code-plugin` with `claude-code`.

## Technical Notes

- New /vision page needs frontmatter: title, description, layout: base.njk, permalink
- Add /vision to `site.json` nav and footerLinks arrays
- Run `npx @11ty/eleventy --input plugins/soleur/docs --output _site_test` to verify build
- All pages must pass `validate-seo.sh` in CI
- PATCH version bump required (docs changes under `plugins/soleur/`)
