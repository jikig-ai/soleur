# Soleur Brand Guide

## Identity

### Mission

Soleur exists to solve one engineering problem: enabling a single founder to build, ship, and scale a billion-dollar company. We are building the Company-as-a-Service platform -- a full-stack AI organization that reviews, plans, builds, and remembers. Every decision the founder makes teaches the system. Every project starts faster than the last.

The name Soleur is a portmanteau of Solo and Solar -- entrepreneur energy and light to better the world.

### Target Audience

Solo founders who think in billions. Technical builders who refuse to accept that scale requires headcount. People who see the trillion-dollar solo company not as science fiction, but as an engineering problem waiting to be solved.

### Positioning

Soleur is not a copilot. Not an assistant. It is a full AI organization -- 23+ agents, 36+ skills, and compounding knowledge -- that operates as every department from strategy to shipping. The brand energy mirrors Tesla and SpaceX: audacious, mission-driven, future-focused. We lead with the ambitious platform vision, never the plugin description.

**Tagline:** The Company-as-a-Service Platform

**Thesis:** "The first trillion-dollar company run by one person isn't science fiction. It's an engineering problem. We're solving it."

## Voice

### Brand Voice

Ambitious-inspiring. Bold, forward-looking, energizing. The voice of Soleur is the voice of someone who has already seen the future and is building it right now. We speak like Vercel markets -- with conviction, precision, and an undercurrent of inevitability.

**Core adjectives:** Bold. Forward-looking. Energizing. Mission-driven. Precise.

### Tone Spectrum

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Marketing / Hero | Maximum ambition, declarative | "Build a Billion-Dollar Company. Alone." |
| Product announcements | Confident, concrete | "23 agents. Every department. From idea to shipped." |
| Technical docs | Clear, precise, no fluff | "The compound skill chains two agents sequentially." |
| Community / Discord | Direct, collaborative, still bold | "Shipped. Try it and tell us what breaks." |
| Error messages | Honest, actionable | "Agent failed. Here's the log. Here's the fix." |

### Do's and Don'ts

**Do:**
- Lead with what becomes possible, not what the tool does
- Use declarative statements ("Build at scale" not "Try building at scale")
- Frame the founder as the decision-maker, the system as the executor
- Use concrete numbers when available (23+ agents, 36+ skills)
- Write like the future is already here
- Use "we" when speaking as Soleur, "you" when addressing the founder
- Keep sentences short and punchy in marketing copy

**Don't:**
- Say "AI-powered" or "leverage AI" -- the entire platform is AI; saying it is redundant
- Use "just" or "simply" -- these minimize the ambition
- Say "assistant" or "copilot" -- Soleur is an organization, not a helper
- Hedge with "might," "could," or "potentially"
- Use startup jargon ("disrupt," "synergy," "move the needle")
- Over-explain -- trust the reader's intelligence
- Use emojis in formal marketing copy (acceptable in Discord)
- Call it a "plugin" or "tool" in public-facing content -- it is a platform

### Example Phrases

**Announcements:**
- "Every department. From idea to shipped."
- "Your AI organization just got smarter."
- "One founder. Full-stack AI. No compromises."

**Product descriptions:**
- "You decide. Agents execute. Knowledge compounds."
- "Not a copilot. Not an assistant. A full AI organization that reviews, plans, builds, and remembers."
- "Designed, built, and shipped by Soleur -- using Soleur."

**Community replies:**
- "Shipped. Let us know what you build with it."
- "Good catch. Fix is in, deploying now."
- "That's the right instinct. Here's how to wire it up."

**Error / system messages:**
- "Agent failed on step 3. Logs attached. Retrying with fallback."
- "Knowledge base updated. 4 new learnings captured."

## Visual Direction

### Color Palette

The visual identity follows the **Solar Forge** direction: raw power being shaped by one person's judgment. Energy against darkness.

| Role | Hex | Usage |
|------|-----|-------|
| Background | `#0A0A0A` | Page and canvas background |
| Surface | `#141414` | Cards, panels, elevated surfaces |
| Border | `#2A2A2A` | Dividers, card borders, subtle structure |
| Gold Accent | `#C9A962` | Section labels, icons, highlights |
| Gold Gradient Start | `#D4B36A` | CTAs, buttons (left/top) |
| Gold Gradient End | `#B8923E` | CTAs, buttons (right/bottom) |
| Text Primary | `#FFFFFF` | Headlines, body text |
| Text Secondary | `#848484` | Subheadlines, descriptions |
| Text Tertiary | `#6A6A6A` | Captions, metadata, timestamps |

**Light mode (Solar Radiance):** A warm cream and amber/gold counterpart palette is under exploration but not yet confirmed. Do not use in production until formally defined.

### Typography

| Role | Font | Weight | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| Headlines | Cormorant Garamond | 500 | Serif -- deliberately distinguishes from every dev tool |
| UI / Body | Inter | 400-600 | Clean, legible, industry standard |
| Data / Code | JetBrains Mono | 400 | Monospace for technical content |
| Section Labels | Inter | 600 | 12px, letterSpacing 3, gold color, ALL CAPS |
| Logo Wordmark | Inter | 500 | letterSpacing 4, spaced-out "SOLEUR" |

### Style

- **Metaphor:** A forge. Raw power being shaped by one person's judgment. Energy against darkness.
- **Corners:** Sharp (0px border-radius). Architectural precision. No rounded corners.
- **Logo:** Gold Circle -- a circular gold stroke containing a serif "S", paired with the spaced-out "SOLEUR" wordmark.
- **Imagery:** Dark backgrounds with gold accents. Minimal, structural. No stock photos of people shaking hands.
- **Motion:** Subtle, purposeful. No bouncing or playful animations. Think: light emerging from darkness.
- **Density:** Generous whitespace. Let the content breathe. The emptiness is part of the power.

## Channel Notes

### Discord

- Tone shifts slightly casual but retains the boldness. Direct, collaborative, builder-to-builder.
- Emojis are acceptable sparingly -- prefer structural ones (arrows, checkmarks) over decorative ones.
- Keep messages concise. If it needs a wall of text, link to docs instead.
- Announcements should still carry the brand energy: declarative, concrete, forward-looking.
- Engage with the community as equals who are building the future together.
- Example announcement: "New: 4 agents for marketing workflows. Strategy to published content in one command. Ship it."
- Example reply: "Good question. The compound skill handles that -- docs here: [link]"

### GitHub

- Maximum technical precision. No marketing language in issues or PRs.
- Commit messages and PR descriptions should be clear and factual.
- Issue responses: acknowledge, explain, resolve. No hedging.
- README and public-facing repo content can carry brand voice but stays grounded in what the software does.
- Use "Soleur" (capitalized) consistently, never "soleur" in prose.
- Example issue response: "Confirmed. The agent resolver doesn't recurse into nested skill directories. Fix in #74."
- Example PR description: "Add brand-architect agent and discord-content skill. Enables interactive brand workshops and Discord content generation from brand guide."

### Website / Landing Page

- Full brand energy. This is where the ambition lives at maximum volume.
- Hero pattern: Badge (ALL CAPS, gold) > Headline (Cormorant Garamond, white) > Subheadline (Inter, secondary text) > CTA (gold gradient button).
- Section pattern: Label (ALL CAPS, gold, Inter 12px 600) > Title (Cormorant Garamond) > Description (Inter, secondary).
- Stats should feel monumental: large numbers, minimal labels.
- The footer tagline is always: "Designed, built, and shipped by Soleur -- using Soleur."
- Final CTA: "Ready to build at scale?" / "Your AI organization is ready. Are you?" / Start Building.
