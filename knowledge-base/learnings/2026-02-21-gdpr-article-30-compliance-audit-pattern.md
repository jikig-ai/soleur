# Learning: GDPR Article 30 Compliance Audit Pattern

## Problem

Needed to determine whether Jikigai (French company) requires an Article 30 processing register for the Soleur plugin, which runs entirely locally with no data collection. The existing legal documents (generated by legal-document-generator) had no Article 30 analysis and several cross-document consistency issues persisted from the initial dogfooding.

## Solution

1. **Ran legal-compliance-auditor** focused on Article 30, providing full company context and existing document inventory upfront
2. **Applied the SME exemption analysis** (Art. 30(5)): the exemption requires ALL three conditions (no risk, occasional, no special categories). Continuous web hosting fails the "occasional" condition, so the exemption does not apply regardless of company size
3. **Identified three processing activities** for the register: docs site hosting, GitHub repo management, and legal inquiry handling
4. **Fixed 15 findings** across three legal documents in both `docs/legal/` and `plugins/soleur/docs/pages/legal/` (the docs site has duplicate copies embedded in Eleventy templates)
5. **Provided register template in French** for private storage -- the register is an internal document, not published in the public repo

## Key Insight

The Article 30(5) SME exemption is narrower than it appears. The CNIL interprets "occasional" strictly -- any continuous web presence (even a static docs site on GitHub Pages) makes processing non-occasional. For French companies with any web presence, assume the register is required regardless of size.

Also: legal documents exist in TWO locations in this repo (`docs/legal/` for source markdown and `plugins/soleur/docs/pages/legal/` for docs site Eleventy templates). Both must be updated in sync. The docs site copies are NOT generated from the source -- they are independent files with different frontmatter (Eleventy layout vs. document metadata).
