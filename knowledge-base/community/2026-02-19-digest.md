## Trending Topics

### 1. Community Management Tooling

The community management agent and skill were built and shipped this week (PRs #128, #130, #132). This includes Discord bot integration, GitHub activity collection, and the setup sub-command. Eight new issues were opened to extend the community agent to X, Reddit, Product Hunt, LinkedIn, Bluesky, Hacker News, Instagram, and TikTok (issues #127, #133-#140).

### 2. Open-Source Coding Agents and Model Flexibility

Discussion in #general about running Claude Code with Ollama and alternative models. ivelin.eth shared experience with opencode, kilocode, cline, and openclaw running local models on DGX Spark. jean.deruelle noted Claude Code has the best UX but explored Ollama support (issue #109 tracks this).

### 3. Documentation and Brand Overhaul

Major documentation migration from custom HTML to Markdown + Eleventy (PR #126), Solar Forge brand website published (PR #92), GitHub Pages deployed (PR #86), and site navigation restructured (PR #118). The docs site is now live at soleur.ai.

### 4. Platform Architecture Evolution

Breaking v2.0.0 release reorganized agents into a domain-first directory structure with 5 company domains: Design, Engineering, Marketing, Operations, Product. Commands consolidated into skills under the soleur: namespace. New agents added: ux-design-lead, terraform-architect, ops-advisor, ops-research, infra-security, brand-architect.

### 5. Licensing Discussion

scottbarstow asked about the Apache vs MIT license choice. jean.deruelle explained Apache is less permissive than MIT (requires sublicensing under same terms) and plans to move to BSL 1.1 at a future milestone, reflecting the business-building intent behind the project.

## Unanswered Questions

| Channel | Author | Question | Timestamp |
|---------|--------|----------|-----------|
| general | jean.deruelle | "Did any of you guys ran Claude Code with ollama and other models?" | 2026-02-17 |

This question received partial engagement (ivelin.eth shared local model experiences) but no definitive answer about Claude Code + Ollama compatibility. The Ollama blog post was shared as reference.
