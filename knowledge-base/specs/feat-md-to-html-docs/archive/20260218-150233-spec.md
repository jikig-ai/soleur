# Spec: Markdown to HTML Docs Site Skill

**Issue:** #120
**Date:** 2026-02-18
**Status:** Draft

## Problem Statement

The Soleur documentation site consists of 5 hand-maintained HTML files (~1,247 lines total). Every new agent or skill addition requires manually editing HTML cards and syncing component counts across multiple files. The raw HTML format is token-heavy for LLM operations. Additionally, the docs infrastructure is not reusable -- other projects built with Soleur cannot leverage it.

## Goals

- G1: Create a reusable `docs-site` skill that scaffolds Markdown + Eleventy docs sites for any project
- G2: Migrate Soleur's existing docs from raw HTML to Markdown as the first consumer of the skill
- G3: Reduce token cost of doc edits by authoring content in Markdown instead of HTML
- G4: Eliminate manual component count syncing via build-time computation
- G5: Preserve the existing visual design (dark theme, gold accents, typography) with minor layout flexibility

## Non-Goals

- Full visual redesign of the documentation site
- Adding new documentation pages beyond the existing 5
- Migrating away from GitHub Pages hosting
- Building a general-purpose SSG framework (this is an opinionated skill, not a library)

## Functional Requirements

- FR1: New `docs-site` skill with SKILL.md providing scaffolding and build instructions
- FR2: Documentation content authored in Markdown files
- FR3: Eleventy (11ty) processes Markdown into static HTML using Nunjucks templates
- FR4: Templates apply existing CSS design system (style.css with layer architecture)
- FR5: Version string injected from plugin.json at build time (no hardcoded versions)
- FR6: Component counts (agents, skills, commands) computed at build time from source files
- FR7: All 5 existing Soleur pages converted: index, agents, skills, getting-started, changelog
- FR8: release-docs skill updated to work with Markdown-based authoring workflow

## Technical Requirements

- TR1: Eleventy installed as devDependency in existing package.json
- TR2: GitHub Actions deploy-docs workflow updated with build step (`npx @11ty/eleventy`)
- TR3: Output directory maps to current docs structure for GitHub Pages deployment
- TR4: Existing CSS, fonts, images, CNAME, robots.txt, sitemap.xml preserved as passthrough files
- TR5: Nunjucks base template wraps Markdown content with site header, nav, footer
- TR6: Data file (e.g., `_data/site.js`) reads plugin.json for version and computes component counts
- TR7: Skill provides scaffolding instructions that work for any project (not just Soleur)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All 5 pages render with equivalent content and visual design
- [ ] Version sourced from plugin.json at build time (not hardcoded in content)
- [ ] Component counts on index, agents, and skills pages match actual inventory
- [ ] GitHub Pages deployment works via updated Actions workflow
- [ ] Adding a new agent/skill requires only updating source data (no HTML edits)
- [ ] `docs-site` skill exists with clear instructions for scaffolding a new docs site
- [ ] release-docs skill documentation updated for new workflow
- [ ] Lighthouse performance score within 5 points of current site
