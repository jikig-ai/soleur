# Spec: Growth Execution Capabilities

**Issue:** #153
**Branch:** feat-growth-execution
**Date:** 2026-02-19

## Problem Statement

The growth-strategist agent produces high-quality content analysis (audit findings, content plans, AEO scores) but cannot execute any of its recommendations. Users must manually apply every rewrite suggestion, keyword injection, and AEO fix. Live testing on soleur.ai showed 10 audit issues, 9 rewrite suggestions, and a 14-article content plan -- all requiring manual work.

## Goals

- G1: Enable programmatic application of growth audit findings to existing site pages
- G2: Enable full article draft generation with brand-consistent voice
- G3: Follow established patterns (seo-aeo fix flow, discord-content brand pipeline)

## Non-Goals

- NG1: Blog infrastructure scaffolding (delegates to docs-site skill)
- NG2: Parallel article generation
- NG3: Growth-plan-aware content writer (independent interface)
- NG4: Separate content validation sub-command

## Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| FR1 | `growth fix <url-or-path>` audits and applies keyword/copy/AEO fixes to existing pages in one pass |
| FR2 | Growth fix applies: keyword injection in headings/body, FAQ sections, definition paragraphs, meta description rewrites |
| FR3 | Growth fix checks brand guide alignment on rewrites when brand guide exists |
| FR4 | Growth fix builds the site after changes to verify compilation |
| FR5 | Growth fix reports all changes made |
| FR6 | `content-writer <topic>` generates a full article draft with Eleventy frontmatter and JSON-LD |
| FR7 | Content-writer reads brand guide Voice section for tone consistency |
| FR8 | Content-writer performs inline brand voice check before presenting draft |
| FR9 | Content-writer presents draft to user for approval before writing to disk |
| FR10 | Content-writer generates FAQ schema when topic warrants it |

## Technical Requirements

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| TR1 | Growth fix modifies growth-strategist agent with an execution step (mode-switching, not separate agent) |
| TR2 | Growth fix sub-command added to existing growth skill |
| TR3 | Content-writer is a new standalone skill at `skills/content-writer/SKILL.md` |
| TR4 | Content-writer requires brand guide as hard prerequisite (fails with message if missing) |
| TR5 | Content-writer requires existing blog infrastructure (directs to docs-site if missing) |
| TR6 | Content-writer accepts optional --outline, --keywords, --path flags |
| TR7 | Version bump required (MINOR -- new skill added) |
