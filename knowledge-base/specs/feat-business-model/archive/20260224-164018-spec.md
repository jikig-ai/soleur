# Spec: Switch License from Apache-2.0 to BSL 1.1

**Issue:** #287
**Date:** 2026-02-24
**Status:** Draft

## Problem Statement

Soleur is currently Apache-2.0 licensed, allowing anyone to fork and commercialize the project without restriction. As the project moves toward a hosted web platform (#297), the agent orchestration architecture, 60+ agent definitions, and 50 skills need IP protection before a competing hosted service can be launched from the same codebase.

## Goals

- G1: Protect Soleur's IP from competing hosted services
- G2: Keep the source available for individual and internal use
- G3: Maintain trust through clear communication and grandfathering
- G4: Auto-convert to Apache-2.0 after 4 years per version

## Non-Goals

- NG1: Building the web platform (see #297)
- NG2: Changing plugin functionality (license change only)
- NG3: Enterprise licensing or dual-license schemes
- NG4: Restricting individual self-hosting

## Functional Requirements

- FR1: BSL 1.1 license text with Additional Use Grant (Option A) in both LICENSE files
- FR2: Updated metadata in plugin.json (BUSL-1.1 SPDX identifier)
- FR3: Updated documentation (READMEs, legal docs, CHANGELOG)
- FR4: Communication plan explaining the change to existing users

## Technical Requirements

- TR1: Prior Apache-2.0 versions (v3.0.9 and earlier) remain grandfathered
- TR2: NOTICE file MIT attribution preserved
- TR3: Version bump to 3.1.0 (MINOR -- not a functional breaking change)
- TR4: Claude Code plugin registry compatibility verified

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] BSL 1.1 license text in both LICENSE files with correct parameters
- [ ] plugin.json license field is `BUSL-1.1`
- [ ] Both READMEs have updated license badges and sections
- [ ] CHANGELOG entry under v3.1.0 explains the license change
- [ ] Legal docs on docs site reference BSL 1.1
- [ ] NOTICE file MIT attribution preserved
- [ ] Communication posted (GitHub Discussion or issue comment)
- [ ] Plugin still installable via `claude plugin install soleur`

## Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Additional Use Grant wording too broad/narrow | Medium | High | Reference HashiCorp/Sentry implementations |
| Community backlash | Low | Medium | Clear communication, grandfathering, 4-year conversion |

## Open Questions

- Should the Additional Use Grant wording be reviewed by external legal counsel? (Recommended for French company per Kieran's review)
- Exact Change Date: "4 years from each version release" vs "February 2030" (rolling vs fixed)
