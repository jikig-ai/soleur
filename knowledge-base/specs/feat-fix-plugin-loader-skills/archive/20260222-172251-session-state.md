# Session State

## Plan Phase
- Plan file: /home/jean/git-repositories/jikig-ai/soleur/.worktrees/feat-fix-plugin-loader-skills/knowledge-base/plans/2026-02-22-fix-remove-community-report-bug-skills-plan.md
- Status: complete

### Errors
None

### Decisions
- Remove SKILL.md files rather than delete entire directories -- the community skill directory must be preserved because the community-manager agent directly references shell scripts at `skills/community/scripts/` (13 call sites). Only the report-bug directory can be fully deleted (contains only SKILL.md).
- Update community-manager agent to reference setup scripts directly -- the agent currently tells users to "run `/soleur:community setup`" at 3 locations. After removing the skill, these references must point to the underlying `discord-setup.sh` script instead.
- Skill count updates span 5 active files, not 3 -- the original plan only considered plugin.json, plugin README, and root README. Deepening found 2 additional locations: `knowledge-base/overview/brand-guide.md` (2 occurrences at lines 21 and 51) and the `skills.js` category comment (line 7). Missing these causes stale counts to propagate into marketing copy and Discord posts.
- PATCH version bump (3.0.3 -> 3.0.4) -- this is a bug fix removing incorrectly-exposed skills, not a breaking change or new feature.
- Historical CHANGELOG entries should not be modified -- grep verification must filter out CHANGELOG.md hits since those are accurate historical records of when these skills existed.

### Components Invoked
- soleur:plan -- Created the initial plan with codebase research
- soleur:deepen-plan -- Enhanced with dependency analysis, count location discovery, and exact line references
