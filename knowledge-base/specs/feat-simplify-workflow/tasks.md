# Tasks: Simplify Workflow (#267)

## Phase 1: Create /soleur:go + Update Help

- [x] 1.1 Create `plugins/soleur/commands/soleur/go.md` with frontmatter (name, description, argument-hint)
- [x] 1.2 Implement no-argument flow (ask "What would you like to do?")
- [x] 1.3 Implement worktree context check (if cwd is worktree, mention it)
- [x] 1.4 Implement intent classification (explore, build, review + ambiguous fallback)
- [x] 1.5 Implement AskUserQuestion confirmation with redirect option
- [x] 1.6 Implement delegation via Skill tool with full argument passthrough
- [x] 1.7 Update `plugins/soleur/commands/soleur/help.md` with new layout (3 recommended + 6 advanced)
