# GDPR Article 30 Compliance Audit Report

**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Scope:** Article 30 RGPD obligations for Jikigai
**Issue:** #187

> **This report was generated by AI and requires professional legal review.**

## Summary

Jikigai (25 rue de Ponthieu, 75008 Paris) must maintain an Article 30 processing register. The SME exemption (Article 30(5)) does not apply because continuous web hosting is not "occasional" processing.

Three processing activities need documenting:
1. Documentation website hosting (soleur.ai via GitHub Pages)
2. Open-source repository management (GitHub)
3. Legal/GDPR inquiry handling (legal@jikigai.com)

No CNIL registration or notification is required (abolished in 2018 reform).

## Recommendations for Counsel

1. **Create the Article 30 register** -- Store privately (not in the public repo). Template provided as `article-30-register-template.md`.
2. **Verify GitHub DPA** -- Confirm Jikigai has accepted GitHub's Data Protection Agreement at https://github.com/customer-terms.
3. **Clarify email provider** -- Verify DPA with email provider for legal@jikigai.com.
4. **Consider breach notification procedure** -- Document internal procedure for handling a potential data breach (Article 33/34).
5. **No CNIL registration needed** -- The 2018 reform eliminated the declaration system entirely.

## Article 30 Register

A template for the register is provided at `article-30-register-template.md` in this directory. This is for private storage -- do NOT commit to the public repository.
