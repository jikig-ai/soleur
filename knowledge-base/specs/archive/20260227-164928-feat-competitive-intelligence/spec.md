# Competitive Intelligence Agent and Skill

**Issue:** #330
**Branch:** feat-competitive-intelligence
**Status:** Draft

## Problem Statement

Soleur has no dedicated competitive intelligence capability. Competitive analysis is fragmented across 4+ agents (business-validator Gate 3, growth-strategist, pricing-strategist, deal-architect), none of which own recurring monitoring. The Cowork Plugins platform threat was discovered 22 days late because `business-validation.md` is a point-in-time snapshot with no review cadence.

## Goals

- G1: Provide recurring, scheduled competitive intelligence reports
- G2: Produce a structured, machine-readable artifact that downstream agents can consume
- G3: Cover Tier 0 (platform threats) and Tier 3 (CaaS competitors) by default with configurable scope
- G4: Integrate with existing knowledge-base patterns and scheduling infrastructure

## Non-Goals

- Multi-agent orchestration of existing specialists (Approach B -- separate issue)
- Broader document cadence enforcement system (Approach C -- separate issue)
- Real-time or event-triggered monitoring (monthly cron is sufficient for v1)
- Replacing business-validator Gate 3 (complementary, not a replacement)

## Functional Requirements

- FR1: A `competitive-intelligence` agent under `agents/product/` that researches competitors via WebSearch/WebFetch
- FR2: Agent reads `brand-guide.md` and `business-validation.md` for positioning context before producing assessments
- FR3: Agent writes/updates `knowledge-base/overview/competitive-intelligence.md` with structured overlap matrix tables
- FR4: A `competitive-analysis` skill under `skills/` that invokes the agent with configurable tier scope
- FR5: Skill supports `$ARGUMENTS` bypass for non-interactive invocation via `soleur:schedule`
- FR6: Default scope: Tier 0 + Tier 3. Accepts `--tiers 0,1,2,3` parameter to configure
- FR7: Output includes `last_reviewed` frontmatter field with scan date

## Technical Requirements

- TR1: Agent frontmatter uses `model: inherit` per model selection policy
- TR2: Agent description fits within remaining token budget (~346 words available)
- TR3: Skill follows third-person description convention
- TR4: Output format uses the overlap matrix from `2026-02-20-marketingskills-overlap-analysis.md` as template
- TR5: Compatible with `soleur:schedule create` for monthly cron via GitHub Actions
- TR6: Disambiguation sentences in agent description vs. `business-validator` and `growth-strategist`

## Output Format

The `competitive-intelligence.md` document structure:

```markdown
---
last_reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD
tiers_scanned: [0, 3]
competitors_tracked: N
---

## Components

| Component | Type | Path |
|-----------|------|------|
| competitive-intelligence | Agent | `agents/product/competitive-intelligence.md` |
| competitive-analysis | Skill | `skills/competitive-analysis/SKILL.md` |
| competitive-intelligence.md | Knowledge-base artifact | `knowledge-base/overview/competitive-intelligence.md` (generated by agent) |

## Dependencies

- `soleur:schedule` skill (v3.5.0) for monthly cron setup
- `business-validation.md` for existing competitive landscape data
- `brand-guide.md` for positioning context
- WebSearch/WebFetch tools for competitor research
