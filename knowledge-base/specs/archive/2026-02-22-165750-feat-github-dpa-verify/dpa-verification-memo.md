# GitHub DPA Verification Memo

> **DRAFT -- This document was generated by AI and requires professional legal review before use. It does not constitute legal advice.**

**Date:** February 21, 2026
**Requested by:** GDPR Article 30 compliance audit (#187, resolved in #200)
**Issue:** #203

---

## 1. Background

The GDPR Article 30 compliance audit identified an outstanding action item: "Verify GitHub DPA -- Confirm Jikigai has accepted GitHub's Data Protection Agreement at https://github.com/customer-terms." This verification is required because Jikigai acts as data controller for the documentation site (soleur.ai) hosted on GitHub Pages, where GitHub acts as data processor.

## 2. Findings

### 2.1 GitHub DPA Scope

GitHub's formal Data Protection Agreement (DPA), available at https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement, applies exclusively to:

- GitHub Enterprise Cloud
- GitHub Enterprise (Unified)
- GitHub Teams
- GitHub Copilot

The DPA is incorporated via the GitHub Customer Agreement and requires corporate terms of service acceptance.

**Source:** GitHub customer-terms page; GitHub Community Discussion #22277 ("GDPR support including Data Protection Agreement is available for corporate accounts that sign the corporate terms of service").

### 2.2 Jikigai's GitHub Plan

Jikigai (`jikig-ai` organization) is on the **free Organization plan** (1 seat). This was confirmed via the GitHub API (`gh api /orgs/jikig-ai`).

### 2.3 Determination

**The formal GitHub DPA does not apply to Jikigai.** Free-tier organizations are not covered by the GitHub Data Protection Agreement. Jikigai has not accepted the DPA because it is not available to free-plan organizations.

### 2.4 Applicable Terms for Free-Plan Organizations

GitHub's data processing for free-plan accounts is governed by:

1. **GitHub Terms of Service** (https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service)
2. **GitHub Privacy Statement** (https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement)

These documents provide substantive data protection commitments:

- GitHub acknowledges its role as processor when organizations provide accounts
- GitHub processes personal data in compliance with the GDPR
- GitHub identifies lawful bases for processing (contractual necessity, legal obligation, legitimate interests, consent)
- GitHub is certified under the **EU-US Data Privacy Framework** (adequacy decision C(2023) 4745)
- GitHub maintains **Standard Contractual Clauses** (European Commission Decision 2021/914) as supplementary safeguard
- GitHub uses sub-processors bound by contractual security, privacy, and confidentiality obligations
- GitHub's sub-processor list is publicly available at https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-subprocessors

### 2.5 Article 28 Compliance Assessment

GDPR Article 28 requires that processing by a processor be "governed by a contract or other legal act under Union or Member State law." The question is whether GitHub's Terms of Service + Privacy Statement constitute an adequate "other legal act" for Article 28 purposes.

**Arguments that the current posture is adequate:**

- GitHub's Privacy Statement explicitly acknowledges processor obligations under GDPR
- The terms are binding legal agreements accepted upon account creation
- GitHub's EU-US DPF certification and SCC commitments provide transfer safeguards
- The processing is minimal (web server logs for a static documentation site)
- No sensitive or special category data is processed

**Arguments that the current posture has gaps:**

- The formal DPA contains specific Article 28(3) provisions (audit rights, sub-processor notification, data deletion upon termination) that the Privacy Statement may not fully replicate
- GDPR Article 28(3) requires the contract to set out "the subject-matter and duration of the processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of personal data and categories of data subjects"
- A supervisory authority (CNIL) could take the position that generic terms of service do not satisfy the specificity requirements of Article 28(3)

## 3. Risk Assessment

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| **Processing scope** | Minimal -- web server logs (IP, user-agent, timestamps) for a static documentation site |
| **Data sensitivity** | Low -- no special categories, no authentication data, no user content |
| **Likelihood of regulatory scrutiny** | Low -- Jikigai is a micro-enterprise with minimal processing |
| **Impact if non-compliant** | Medium -- potential CNIL inquiry, but corrective measures available (upgrade plan) |
| **Overall risk** | Low |

## 4. Recommendations for Counsel

### Option A: Accept Current Posture (Recommended for Now)

**Rationale:** GitHub's Terms of Service and Privacy Statement provide substantive GDPR protections. The processing is minimal (web server logs for a documentation site), involves no sensitive data, and GitHub's DPF certification provides a recognized international transfer mechanism. The compliance gap is narrow and the risk of enforcement action against a micro-enterprise for this specific gap is low.

**Action required:** Update GDPR policy to accurately describe the applicable terms (ToS + Privacy Statement) instead of referencing the formal DPA.

### Option B: Upgrade to GitHub Teams

**Cost:** $4/user/month ($48/year for 1 seat)
**Benefit:** Access to the formal GitHub DPA with explicit Article 28(3) provisions.
**When to consider:** If Jikigai grows, processes more data, or wants to eliminate the compliance gap entirely.

### Option C: Alternative Hosting

**Options:** Cloudflare Pages (DPA available on free plan), Netlify (DPA available), Vercel (DPA available)
**When to consider:** If the GitHub Pages dependency becomes problematic for other reasons.

## 5. GDPR Policy Update

The GDPR policy Section 2.2 has been updated to accurately reflect that GitHub's processing is governed by the GitHub Terms of Service and GitHub Privacy Statement (not the formal DPA). The reference to the GitHub Data Protection Agreement has been replaced with accurate terms.

## 6. Article 30 Register Impact

The Article 30 register template should note under the GitHub Pages processing activity:

- **Applicable terms:** GitHub Terms of Service + GitHub Privacy Statement (formal DPA not available on free plan)
- **Transfer mechanism:** EU-US Data Privacy Framework (adequacy decision C(2023) 4745); Standard Contractual Clauses as supplement
- **Status:** Counsel review recommended for Article 28 adequacy determination
