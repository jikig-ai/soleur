# Soleur Growth Strategy: Keyword Research, Content Gap Analysis, and Content Plan

## 1. Keyword Research

### 1A. Primary Keyword Cluster: "Agentic Company / Agentic Enterprise"

| Keyword | Search Intent | Relevance | Competition | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| agentic company | Informational | **H** | Medium | Emerging term; McKinsey, Salesforce, Deloitte all publishing definitions. Soleur can own the "one-person" angle. |
| agentic enterprise | Informational | **H** | High | Dominated by Salesforce ("Agentforce"), McKinsey, Deloitte. Enterprise framing -- Soleur's solo-founder angle is a differentiator. |
| agentic organization | Informational | **H** | High | McKinsey coined this. High authority competition but strong search interest. |
| what is an agentic company | Informational | **H** | Low | Question-format query ideal for an explainer page. Low competition for this exact phrasing. |
| agentic AI for business | Informational/Commercial | **M** | High | Broad; dominated by enterprise vendors (Salesforce, Microsoft, UiPath). |
| agentic era | Informational | **M** | Medium | Fortune, Deloitte publishing on this. Thought-leadership opportunity. |
| silicon-based workforce | Informational | **L** | Low | Niche term from Deloitte's framing. Low volume but strong conceptual hook. |

### 1B. Primary Keyword Cluster: "Company as a Service"

| Keyword | Search Intent | Relevance | Competition | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| company as a service | Informational/Commercial | **H** | **Very Low** | This is Soleur's own term. Near-zero competition. Massive opportunity to own the SERP. |
| company as a service platform | Commercial | **H** | Very Low | More specific variant. Soleur is literally the only product using this framing. |
| AI as a service (AIaaS) | Informational/Commercial | **M** | High | Established term (Encord, AWS, etc. rank). Related but different -- Soleur is NOT AIaaS. Use for contrast, not targeting. |
| business as a service | Informational | **M** | Medium | Adjacent concept. Some overlap with BPaaS (Business Process as a Service). |
| full-stack AI organization | Informational/Commercial | **H** | Very Low | Soleur's positioning language. No competitors using this phrase. Own it. |

### 1C. Primary Keyword Cluster: "Agentic Engineering"

| Keyword | Search Intent | Relevance | Competition | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| agentic engineering | Informational | **H** | Medium | Zed and Glide have published definitions. Soleur's workflow (brainstorm/plan/work/review/compound) is a textbook implementation. |
| compound engineering | Informational | **H** | Medium | Every.to coined this. Soleur's `/compound` skill is a direct implementation. High relevance, moderate competition. |
| AI agent orchestration | Informational/Commercial | **H** | High | Crowded (CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen). Soleur competes differently -- it's a dev workflow tool, not a general-purpose orchestration framework. |
| multi-agent code review | Informational/Commercial | **H** | Medium | Qodo dominates. Soleur has 13+ review agents -- strong differentiator. Comparison content opportunity. |
| AI coding workflow | Informational | **H** | Medium | Broad term capturing the workflow-automation audience. |
| vibe coding vs agentic engineering | Informational | **M** | Low | Emerging distinction (Glide article). Soleur is firmly on the "agentic engineering" side. |
| Claude Code plugin | Navigational/Commercial | **H** | Low | Direct product searches. Soleur should rank for this. Limited competition in the plugin ecosystem. |
| Claude Code extensions | Navigational/Commercial | **H** | Low | Variant of above. awesome-claude-code lists exist but no dominant authority. |
| best Claude Code plugins 2026 | Commercial | **H** | Low | Listicle/comparison intent. Soleur should appear in or create these. |

### 1D. Primary Keyword Cluster: "Solo Founder AI / One-Person Company"

| Keyword | Search Intent | Relevance | Competition | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| solo founder AI tools | Commercial | **H** | Medium | Multiple articles (SiliconIndia, Nucamp, Medium). High buyer intent. |
| one person billion dollar company | Informational | **H** | Medium | Viral topic (Altman, Amodei predictions). Soleur's entire thesis. |
| billion dollar solo company | Informational | **H** | Medium | Variant. Sam Altman and Dario Amodei both quoted on this. |
| first billion dollar one person company 2026 | Informational | **H** | Medium | Timely -- Amodei predicted 2026 with 70-80% confidence. |
| solopreneur AI stack 2026 | Commercial | **H** | Medium | PrometAI, Entrepreneur.com publishing. Soleur as the engineering layer of the stack. |
| AI tools for solopreneurs | Commercial | **M** | High | Very broad. Dominated by Entrepreneur.com, Medium listicles. |
| one person SaaS AI | Commercial | **H** | Low | Specific to SaaS builders. Strong fit for Soleur's audience. |
| AI replace employees startup | Informational | **M** | Medium | Controversial angle. Could drive traffic but requires careful framing. |

### 1E. Secondary Keywords (Long-Tail / Supporting)

| Keyword | Search Intent | Relevance | Competition | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| knowledge compounding AI development | Informational | **H** | Very Low | Soleur's unique differentiator. Almost no competition. |
| AI agent memory software development | Informational | **M** | Low | Cognee, Knowledge Plane are in this space but different category. |
| AI development workflow automation | Informational/Commercial | **M** | Medium | Broad but relevant. |
| how to build a company with AI agents | Informational | **H** | Low | Tutorial/guide intent. Perfect for long-form content. |
| AI code review multiple agents | Commercial | **M** | Low | Specific query Soleur can answer directly. |
| Claude Code vs CrewAI | Commercial | **M** | Low | Comparison query. Different tools, but searchers exploring options. |
| structured AI development methodology | Informational | **M** | Very Low | Academic-sounding but captures methodology seekers. |
| brainstorm plan work review ship AI | Informational | **L** | Very Low | Exact workflow match. Very long-tail but high conversion if found. |

## 2. Existing Content Audit (soleur.ai)

### Current Sitemap (5 pages)

| URL | Content Type | Keywords Targeted | Search Intent Served |
|-----|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| `/` (Homepage) | Landing page | "company as a service", "billion dollar company alone" | Commercial/Navigational |
| `/pages/getting-started.html` | Documentation | "install soleur", "claude code plugin" | Transactional/Navigational |
| `/pages/agents.html` | Reference catalog | "AI agents code review", agent names | Navigational |
| `/pages/skills.html` | Reference catalog | "AI skills workflow", skill names | Navigational |
| `/pages/changelog.html` | Release notes | Version-specific queries | Navigational |

### What the Site Does Well

- Strong hero messaging aligned with brand thesis ("Build a Billion-Dollar Company. Alone.")
- Good structured data (JSON-LD WebSite, WebPage, SoftwareApplication)
- OG tags, Twitter cards, canonical URLs all present
- llms.txt for AI model discoverability
- Clean sitemap with lastmod dates
- Clear product narrative (you decide, agents execute, knowledge compounds)

### What the Site Does NOT Have

- **No blog or article section.** Zero informational content.
- **No concept explainer pages.** Terms like "company as a service", "agentic engineering", "knowledge compounding" are used but never defined or explored.
- **No comparison pages.** No "Soleur vs X" or "how Soleur differs from CrewAI/Devin/Cursor."
- **No use case pages.** No "how to build a SaaS with Soleur" or "solo founder workflow" content.
- **No thought leadership.** The Soleur thesis is stated but never argued or elaborated.
- **No tutorials or guides.** Getting Started is minimal (install command + workflow list). No deep dives.
- **No FAQ or glossary.** Terms like "agentic engineering" or "compound engineering" used without explanation.
- **No social proof or case studies.** No "built with Soleur" examples.

---

## 3. Content Gap Analysis

### Gap 1: CRITICAL -- No Informational Content Layer

**Problem:** The site is 100% product documentation and 0% content marketing. It serves people who already know about Soleur (navigational intent) but captures zero organic traffic from people discovering the category (informational intent).

**Impact:** Soleur is invisible to the estimated thousands of monthly searches for "agentic company", "solo founder AI tools", "agentic engineering", "one person billion dollar company", and related terms. These are the exact audience for the product.

**Opportunity:** 80%+ of the target keywords are informational. Without a blog or article section, Soleur cannot rank for any of them.

### Gap 2: HIGH -- Owns Unique Terminology but Does Not Define It

**Problem:** Soleur coined "Company-as-a-Service" and uses it prominently. But there is no dedicated page defining the term, explaining the concept, or positioning it against existing models (SaaS, AIaaS, BPaaS). Anyone searching "company as a service" finds nothing authoritative -- Soleur could be the Wikipedia of its own category.

Similarly, "knowledge compounding" is a core differentiator mentioned on the homepage but never explained. The compound engineering movement (Every.to) has created search interest, and Soleur's `/compound` skill is a direct implementation -- but the site never mentions this connection.

### Gap 3: HIGH -- No Competitive Positioning Content

**Problem:** People searching "Claude Code plugins", "AI agent platform comparison", "CrewAI alternatives", "best AI code review tools 2026" are high-intent buyers comparing options. Soleur has no comparison or positioning content. The agents page is a reference catalog, not a persuasive argument.

**Impact:** Soleur does not appear in any "best of" or "vs" search results. These queries have high commercial intent and above-average conversion rates.

### Gap 4: HIGH -- The "Billion-Dollar Solo Company" Narrative Is Unclaimed

**Problem:** Dario Amodei (Anthropic CEO) predicted the first billion-dollar one-person company by 2026 with 70-80% confidence. Sam Altman has a "betting pool" with tech CEO friends on when it happens. This is THE narrative of 2026. Soleur's entire thesis is this narrative. But soleur.ai has zero content capitalizing on it -- just a homepage quote with no elaboration.

**Impact:** Orbilontech, Cipher Projects, Medium authors, and news outlets are capturing this traffic. Soleur -- the product literally building toward this vision -- is absent from the conversation.

### Gap 5: MEDIUM -- No Tutorial or "How To" Content

**Problem:** "How to build a company with AI agents", "solopreneur AI workflow", "AI development methodology" are queries with tutorial intent. The Getting Started page is a bullet-point install guide, not a walkthrough.

### Gap 6: MEDIUM -- No AI Agent Consumability Content

**Problem:** Soleur has llms.txt (good), but as AI-powered search (Perplexity, ChatGPT Search, Google AI Overviews) becomes a primary discovery channel, the site needs content structured for AI extraction -- FAQ schemas, conversational Q&A sections, machine-readable summaries. The existing structured data covers basic SEO but not AEO depth.

## 4. Prioritized Content Plan

### P1: High Impact (Ship Within 2-4 Weeks)

---

#### P1.1: "What Is Company-as-a-Service?" -- Definitive Explainer

- **Content Type:** Long-form article / pillar page (2,000-3,000 words)
- **Target Keywords:** `company as a service`, `company as a service platform`, `full-stack AI organization`, `what is company as a service`
- **Search Intent:** Informational
- **URL:** `/articles/what-is-company-as-a-service`
- **Outline:**
  1. Opening: The evolution from SaaS to AIaaS to CaaS -- what changes when AI runs the company, not just the software
  2. Definition: Company-as-a-Service means packaging every department (strategy, engineering, marketing, operations, support) as AI agents orchestrated by a single founder's judgment
  3. How it differs from: SaaS (you rent software), AIaaS (you rent models), BPaaS (you outsource processes), CaaS (you orchestrate an AI organization)
  4. The three pillars: You Decide, Agents Execute, Knowledge Compounds
  5. What a CaaS platform looks like in practice (Soleur's architecture as the reference implementation)
  6. Who it's for: Solo founders, technical builders, small teams that refuse to accept scale requires headcount
  7. FAQ section (for AI agent consumability)
- **Why P1:** Soleur owns this term. Zero competition. Every Google search for "company as a service" should land here. This is category creation.

---

#### P1.2: "The Billion-Dollar Solo Company: How AI Makes It Possible in 2026"

- **Content Type:** Thought leadership article (2,500-3,500 words)
- **Target Keywords:** `one person billion dollar company`, `billion dollar solo company`, `first billion dollar one person company 2026`, `solo founder AI`
- **Search Intent:** Informational
- **URL:** `/articles/billion-dollar-solo-company`
- **Outline:**
  1. The predictions: Dario Amodei (2026, 70-80% confidence), Sam Altman (betting pool with tech CEOs), Mike Krieger (built Instagram with 13, could do it with 2 + Claude)
  2. Why the predictions are credible: Task complexity doubling every 4 months, 41% of code now AI-assisted, 95-98% cost reduction in solopreneur stacks
  3. The missing piece: Tools optimize individual tasks, but nobody has built the organizational layer -- the AI that operates as a company, not just a copilot
  4. The Soleur thesis: This is an engineering problem, not a fantasy. Here is how we are solving it.
  5. The three requirements: Judgment (human), execution (agents), memory (knowledge compounding)
  6. What the first billion-dollar solo company probably looks like (sector analysis: dev tools, proprietary trading, self-serve SaaS)
  7. CTA: Start building with Soleur
- **Why P1:** Highest-volume informational keyword in the target cluster. Viral potential. Directly aligned with brand thesis. Amodei's 2026 prediction creates urgency and timeliness.

---

#### P1.3: "Agentic Engineering: Beyond Vibe Coding"

- **Content Type:** Long-form article / pillar page (2,000-2,500 words)
- **Target Keywords:** `agentic engineering`, `compound engineering`, `vibe coding vs agentic engineering`, `AI coding workflow`, `structured AI development methodology`
- **Search Intent:** Informational
- **URL:** `/articles/agentic-engineering`
- **Outline:**
  1. The problem with vibe coding: Fast but fragile. No planning, no review, no memory. Works for prototypes, fails for production.
  2. What agentic engineering actually means: Delegation + supervision. Structured workflows. Multi-agent collaboration. Quality gates.
  3. The compound engineering connection: Every.to's methodology. The four-phase loop: plan, work, review, compound. How Soleur implements this natively.
  4. Knowledge compounding: Why the AGENTS.md / knowledge-base pattern changes everything. Each bug fixed makes the next feature easier.
  5. Soleur's implementation: 31 agents, 40 skills, the brainstorm-plan-work-review-compound lifecycle. Not a framework to build on -- a ready-made AI engineering organization.
  6. Comparison table: Vibe coding vs. agentic engineering vs. compound engineering (definitions, tools, when to use each)
  7. FAQ section
- **Why P1:** "Agentic engineering" is an emerging term with growing search interest (Zed, Glide publishing). Soleur's workflow is a textbook implementation. Connecting to "compound engineering" (Every.to) taps into an existing audience.

---

#### P1.4: Blog/Articles Section Infrastructure

- **Content Type:** Site infrastructure (Eleventy collection, layout template, index page)
- **Target Keywords:** N/A (enables all content above)
- **Search Intent:** N/A
- **URL:** `/articles/` (index), individual article URLs
- **Requirements:**
  1. Eleventy collection for articles with frontmatter (title, description, date, keywords, author)
  2. Article layout template matching brand guide (dark background, Cormorant Garamond headlines, Inter body)
  3. Article index page with chronological listing
  4. JSON-LD Article structured data on each article
  5. Automatic sitemap inclusion
  6. OG/Twitter meta tags per article
  7. Internal linking from homepage and navigation
- **Why P1:** Without this infrastructure, no content can be published. This is the prerequisite for everything in the plan.

---

### P2: Medium Impact (Ship Within 4-8 Weeks)

---

#### P2.1: "Soleur vs. CrewAI vs. Cursor vs. Devin: How Soleur Is Different"

- **Content Type:** Comparison page (1,500-2,000 words)
- **Target Keywords:** `Claude Code plugin`, `best Claude Code plugins 2026`, `AI agent platform comparison`, `CrewAI alternatives`, `Soleur vs CrewAI`
- **Search Intent:** Commercial
- **URL:** `/articles/soleur-vs-alternatives`
- **Outline:**
  1. The categories: Agent frameworks (CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen), AI coding tools (Cursor, Devin, Codex), workflow orchestrators (Soleur, compound-engineering-plugin). These are different things.
  2. Soleur is not a framework -- it is a ready-made AI organization. You do not build agents; you deploy departments.
  3. Comparison matrix: Number of agents, skill scope, knowledge compounding, workflow structure, target user, pricing
  4. When to use each tool (honest positioning)
  5. The "and" argument: Soleur works with Claude Code. Cursor is a different layer entirely. CrewAI is for building custom agents; Soleur is for using pre-built ones.
- **Why P2:** High commercial intent but requires more nuance. Comparison keywords drive purchase decisions.

---

#### P2.2: "The Solopreneur AI Stack: Engineering Layer"

- **Content Type:** Guide (1,500-2,000 words)
- **Target Keywords:** `solopreneur AI stack 2026`, `solo founder AI tools`, `one person SaaS AI`, `AI tools for solopreneurs`
- **Search Intent:** Commercial/Informational
- **URL:** `/articles/solopreneur-ai-stack`
- **Outline:**
  1. The full solopreneur stack: Content (ChatGPT/Claude), Design (Midjourney/Canva), Automation (Make/Zapier), Finance (AI bookkeeping), Engineering (??)
  2. The engineering gap: Every article about solopreneur AI stacks lists content and marketing tools. None address the engineering workflow.
  3. What "engineering" means for a solo founder: Code review, architecture, security, deployment, documentation -- all the things a CTO does
  4. Soleur as the engineering layer: 31 agents covering every engineering discipline
  5. The complete stack recommendation: Soleur for engineering + recommended tools for other layers
  6. Cost analysis: Full AI organization for the price of one contractor
- **Why P2:** Targets the large "solopreneur AI tools" search volume while positioning Soleur specifically for the engineering layer nobody else covers.

---

#### P2.3: "What Is Knowledge Compounding in AI Development?"

- **Content Type:** Concept explainer (1,500-2,000 words)
- **Target Keywords:** `knowledge compounding AI development`, `AI agent memory software development`, `compound engineering methodology`, `AI learning loop development`
- **Search Intent:** Informational
- **URL:** `/articles/knowledge-compounding`
- **Outline:**
  1. The problem: Every AI coding session starts from zero. Context is lost. Mistakes repeat.
  2. Knowledge compounding defined: Each solved problem teaches the system. Each project starts faster than the last.
  3. How it works: The AGENTS.md pattern, structured learnings, decision records, pattern libraries
  4. The compound engineering movement: Every.to's methodology and how it formalized the approach
  5. Soleur's implementation: The `/compound` skill, knowledge-base directory, brainstorms, learnings, how they feed into future agent context
  6. The flywheel effect: More development -> more knowledge -> faster development -> more knowledge
  7. Why this is the real moat: Tools commoditize. Knowledge compounds.
- **Why P2:** Unique differentiator with almost zero competition. Connects to the growing "compound engineering" conversation.

---

- **Search Intent:** Informational
- **URL:** `/articles/build-saas-solo-founder`
- **Outline:**
  1. The premise: You have an idea. You have Soleur. Here is how you go from zero to shipped product.
  2. Phase 1 -- Brainstorm: Using `/soleur:brainstorm` to explore the problem space
  3. Phase 2 -- Plan: Using `/soleur:plan` to create implementation specs
  4. Phase 3 -- Build: Using `/soleur:work` with parallel agents
  5. Phase 4 -- Review: Multi-agent code review catching what solo devs miss
  6. Phase 5 -- Ship: One command from tests to deploy to announce
  7. Phase 6 -- Compound: Capturing learnings so the next feature is faster
  8. Real example: Walk through building an actual feature using the workflow
- **Why P2:** Tutorial content converts browsers into users. Shows the product in action rather than describing it abstractly.

---

### P3: Future (8+ Weeks / Ongoing)

---

#### P3.1: "The Agentic Company Glossary"

- **Content Type:** Glossary / reference page
- **Target Keywords:** `what is an agentic company`, `agentic enterprise definition`, `agentic organization meaning`, `silicon-based workforce`
- **Search Intent:** Informational

- **Brief:** Define 20-30 terms in the agentic company space. Each definition becomes a potential featured snippet. Cross-link to pillar articles. Include FAQ schema for AI consumability.

#### P3.2: "Multi-Agent Code Review: Why One AI Reviewer Is Not Enough"

- **Content Type:** Technical deep dive (2,000 words)
- **Target Keywords:** `multi-agent code review`, `AI code review multiple agents`, `automated code review 2026`
- **Search Intent:** Informational/Commercial
- **URL:** `/articles/multi-agent-code-review`
- **Brief:** Explain why single-model code review produces generic feedback. Show how specialized agents (security, performance, architecture, Rails-specific, legacy code) catch different classes of issues. Position Soleur's 13+ review agents against Qodo, Codex, Cursor Bugbot.

#### P3.3: "Built with Soleur" Case Studies

- **Content Type:** Case study series (800-1,200 words each)
- **Target Keywords:** `AI built software examples`, `solo founder case study`, `company as a service examples`
- **Search Intent:** Commercial
- **URL:** `/articles/built-with-soleur/[case-name]`
- **Brief:** Document real projects built using Soleur's workflow. Include before/after metrics, workflow screenshots, agent usage. Start with soleur.ai itself ("designed, built, and shipped by Soleur -- using Soleur").

## 6. Key Strategic Notes

**Category creation over category capture.** Soleur's biggest opportunity is not competing for "AI agent platform" (crowded, enterprise-dominated). It is defining and owning "Company-as-a-Service" -- a term with zero competition and perfect alignment with the product. P1.1 is the single most important piece of content.

**Ride the Amodei/Altman narrative.** The "one-person billion-dollar company" prediction is the most viral AI narrative of 2026. Soleur's thesis IS this narrative. P1.2 connects Soleur to the conversation that every tech publication is already writing about.

**Bridge to compound engineering.** Every.to's compound engineering methodology has created organic search interest and a community of practitioners. Soleur implements compound engineering natively. P1.3 and P2.3 connect Soleur to this existing audience without competing with Every.

**Informational-first, commercial-second.** 80% of target keywords are informational. The site currently serves 0% informational queries. Fixing this asymmetry is the highest-leverage growth action. Commercial content (P2.1, P2.2) converts the traffic that informational content attracts.

**AEO as a compounding advantage.** As AI-powered search grows (Perplexity, ChatGPT, Google AI Overviews), content structured for AI extraction gets cited more. FAQ schemas, conversational sections, and machine-readable summaries compound over time as AI models learn to cite Soleur as an authority on "company as a service" and "agentic engineering."
