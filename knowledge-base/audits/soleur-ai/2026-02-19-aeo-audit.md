## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Conversational Readiness (2/10)

**Test:** If a user asks an AI "What is Soleur?", can the AI quote a clear, factual sentence from this page?

**Finding: FAIL.** There is no sentence on the homepage that a model could extract as a direct, factual answer. Here is what exists:

- Hero badge: *"The Company-as-a-Service Platform"* -- This is a tagline, not a definition. It does not say what Soleur actually is (a plugin, a CLI tool, a SaaS product).
- Hero heading: *"Build a Billion-Dollar Company. Alone."* -- Pure aspiration. Not quotable as a factual description.
- Hero subheading: *"Everything you need to build, ship, and scale -- powered by AI teams. For founders who think in billions."* -- Marketing copy. Does not explain what the product does.
- Section copy: *"Not a copilot. Not an assistant. A full AI organization that reviews, plans, builds, and remembers."* -- This comes closest to being useful but is framed negatively and still lacks specifics (what kind of software? for whom? how is it installed?).

**What an AI model needs:** A sentence like: *"Soleur is an open-source Claude Code plugin that provides 31 AI agents and 40 skills for software development, enabling a structured workflow of brainstorming, planning, building, reviewing, and compounding knowledge."*

**This sentence does not exist anywhere on the site.**

The Getting Started page has the install command (`claude plugin install soleur`) but never states that Soleur is a Claude Code plugin in prose form. The agents page says "31 specialized agents" in a subtitle but doesn't define what a Soleur agent is.

---

### 2. FAQ Structure (0/10)

**Test:** Does the page contain question-and-answer pairs matching common search queries?

**Finding: FAIL.** There is zero FAQ content on the homepage or any subpage. No `<details>` elements, no Q&A sections, no "Frequently Asked Questions" heading.

**Missing queries that users and AI systems would ask:**

- "What is Soleur?"
- "How do I install Soleur?"
- "What is a Claude Code plugin?"
- "What agents does Soleur include?"
- "Is Soleur free?"
- "What is knowledge compounding?"
- "How does Soleur compare to GitHub Copilot?"
- "What programming languages does Soleur support?"
- "Does Soleur work on Windows/Linux/macOS?"

The Getting Started page answers *some* of these implicitly through its code blocks, but none are structured as explicit Q&A pairs that an AI engine can extract.

---

### 3. Definition Extractability (1/10)

**Test:** Are key terms defined in clear, quotable sentences near their first usage?

**Finding: FAIL.** Every key term on the site is used without ever being defined.

| Term | First Appearance | Definition Provided? | Problem |
|---|---|---|---|
| Soleur | Hero badge | No | Never defined. Is it a company? Product? Plugin? Platform? |
| Company-as-a-Service | Hero badge | No | Novel term, completely undefined |
| AI teams | Hero subheading | No | Vague. Teams of what? Agents? |
| Agents | Stats strip ("31 AI Agents") | No | The word "agents" is used but never defined as "specialized AI personas with domain expertise that execute tasks within Claude Code" or similar |
| Skills | Stats strip ("40 Skills") | No | Never defined. Could mean anything. |
| Knowledge Compounding | Stats strip | No | Never defined. The phrase appears 4 times but is never explained with a concrete sentence. |
| Automated Workflow | Stats strip | No | Which workflow? Never specified. |

The one point awarded is for the Problem section's card text: *"Solutions compound into patterns. Patterns compound into playbooks."* -- this gestures at a definition of knowledge compounding but never makes it explicit.

---

### 4. Summary Quality (2/10)

**Test:** Is there a clear, factual summary paragraph that an AI could use to describe the product?

**Finding: FAIL.** The entire homepage is aspirational marketing. There is no paragraph that contains concrete, verifiable facts about what Soleur is, what it does, how it works, or who it is for.

**Closest candidates:**

1. *"Not a copilot. Not an assistant. A full AI organization that reviews, plans, builds, and remembers. Every decision you make teaches the system. Every project starts faster than the last."* -- This is the most information-dense paragraph, but it still does not say: what technology Soleur is built on, how you install it, what it costs, or what it actually produces.

2. The Getting Started page has factual content (install command, 5-step workflow) but lacks a summary paragraph synthesizing this into a coherent description.

**Factual claims that are buried or missing entirely:**
- Soleur is free (price: $0 appears only in JSON-LD, never in visible text)
- Soleur requires Claude Code CLI (appears only in JSON-LD)
- Soleur is version 2.15.1 (appears only in JSON-LD)
- Soleur runs on macOS, Linux, Windows (appears only in JSON-LD)
- Soleur is open source on GitHub (implied by the GitHub link but never stated in prose)

All of these facts are in the structured data but **none** appear in human-readable text that AI engines parse for conversational answers.

---

### 5. Citation-Friendly Structure (3/10)

**Test:** Do paragraphs make standalone factual claims? Are key facts in plain text (not icons, code blocks, or interactive elements)?

**Finding: PARTIAL FAIL.** The feature cards have standalone sentences, but most are vague or aspirational rather than factual.

**Positive:**
- Feature cards each have a heading and one-line description. These are extractable.
- The Getting Started page has a clean command-per-step structure.
- The Agents page lists all 31 agents with names and one-line descriptions.

**Negative:**
- Stats strip uses raw numbers without context. "31 AI Agents" -- agents for what? The stat is not self-explanatory.
- The infinity symbol for "Compounding Knowledge" is a unicode character, not text.
- Critical facts about the product are never stated in paragraph form.
- No content on the homepage can be cited by an AI as a source for a factual claim because there are no factual claims -- only marketing assertions.

---

## Prioritized Recommendations

### Priority 1: Add a Factual Definition Paragraph (CRITICAL)

Add a clearly identifiable "What is Soleur?" section at the top of the homepage, immediately after the hero. This single paragraph should contain:

```
Soleur is a free, open-source plugin for Claude Code that provides 31 specialized
AI agents, 40 multi-step skills, and a knowledge compounding system for software
development. It runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Instead of acting as a copilot
that autocompletes code, Soleur provides a full AI organization -- with agents for
engineering, product, marketing, operations, and design -- that follows a structured
workflow: brainstorm, plan, build, review, and compound learnings. Install it with
`claude plugin install soleur`.
```

This one paragraph would fix most of the "conversational readiness" and "definition extractability" failures. It contains: what it is, what it costs, where it runs, how it differs from alternatives, and how to get it.

### Priority 2: Add an FAQ Section (CRITICAL)

Create a dedicated FAQ section on the homepage (or a `/pages/faq.html` page linked prominently). Structure it as visible `<h3>` question headings followed by `<p>` answer paragraphs. Target these queries at minimum:

1. **What is Soleur?** (definition paragraph from above)
2. **How do I install Soleur?** (one-line answer + code block)
3. **Is Soleur free?** ("Yes. Soleur is free and open source under [license].")
4. **What is a Claude Code plugin?** (brief explanation for context)
5. **What agents does Soleur include?** (summary list with link to /pages/agents.html)
6. **What is knowledge compounding?** (define the term explicitly)
7. **What programming languages and frameworks does Soleur support?** (list them)
8. **How does Soleur differ from GitHub Copilot or Cursor?** (clear comparison)
9. **Does Soleur require an API key?** (practical usage question)
10. **Where can I get help?** (Discord + GitHub links)

### Priority 3: Define Key Terms Inline (HIGH)

At every first usage of a novel or ambiguous term, add a parenthetical or follow-on sentence that defines it:

- **"31 AI Agents"** --> "31 AI agents -- specialized personas like code-quality-analyst, security-sentinel, and brand-architect that execute domain-specific tasks within Claude Code."
- **"40 Skills"** --> "40 skills -- multi-step automated workflows like brainstorming, code review, deployment, and release announcement."
- **"Knowledge Compounding"** --> "Knowledge compounding -- a system that captures solutions, patterns, and decisions as searchable documentation so every future project starts with the accumulated knowledge of all past projects."
- **"Company-as-a-Service"** --> "Company-as-a-Service -- a platform that replaces the functions of an entire startup team (engineering, product, marketing, operations) with coordinated AI agents."

### Priority 4: Surface JSON-LD Facts as Visible Text (HIGH)

The JSON-LD structured data contains facts that never appear in visible content. These need to be surfaced:

- **Price: Free** -- Add "Free and open source" as visible text, not just `"price": "0"` in JSON-LD.
- **Requires: Claude Code CLI** -- State this prerequisite in visible text on both the homepage and Getting Started page.
- **Platform: macOS, Linux, Windows** -- Add platform compatibility as visible text.
- **Version: 2.15.1** -- Consider adding a visible version badge.

### Priority 5: Replace Marketing Assertions with Factual Claims (MEDIUM)

Rewrite or supplement aspirational copy with concrete, verifiable statements:

| Current (Marketing) | Suggested Addition (Factual) |
|---|---|
| "Build a Billion-Dollar Company. Alone." | Keep as headline, but follow with the factual definition paragraph |
| "Everything you need to build, ship, and scale" | "A 5-step development workflow: brainstorm, plan, build, review, compound -- each powered by specialized AI agents" |
| "Every department, running autonomously on your command" | "Engineering (23 agents for code review, architecture, security, testing), Marketing (3 agents for brand, community, SEO), Operations (2 agents for cost tracking and research), Product (1 agent for spec analysis), Design (1 agent for UX)" |
| "One command. Tests, review, commit, deploy, announce. Done." | "The `/soleur:ship` skill runs tests, multi-agent code review, git commit, deployment, and release announcement in a single automated pipeline" |

### Priority 6: Add a "How It Works" Section with Concrete Steps (MEDIUM)

The Getting Started page has the 5-step workflow, but the homepage does not. Add a visible "How It Works" section that shows the concrete workflow with command names, making it quotable:

1. `/soleur:brainstorm` -- Explore the problem space with structured dialogue
2. `/soleur:plan` -- Create an implementation plan with architecture and task breakdown
3. `/soleur:work` -- Execute the plan with parallel AI agents and quality checks
4. `/soleur:review` -- Run multi-agent code review (14 specialized reviewers)
5. `/soleur:compound` -- Capture learnings as searchable knowledge for future projects

---

## Summary

The soleur.ai homepage is currently optimized for human emotional response (aspirational messaging, dramatic stats, bold claims) but is nearly useless for AI engine consumption. An AI model asked "What is Soleur?" would struggle to produce any factual answer from this content because the site never actually says what Soleur is, what it costs, what it requires, or how it works in plain, quotable prose.

The gap between the JSON-LD structured data (which contains real facts) and the visible page content (which contains almost none) is the single largest AEO failure. Every fact in the structured data should also appear in human-readable text.

Implementing Priorities 1 and 2 alone (a definition paragraph and an FAQ section) would likely raise the overall AEO score from 1.6/10 to approximately 6/10. All six priorities together could bring it to 8-9/10.
