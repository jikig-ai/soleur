# Sales Domain Brainstorm

**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Issue:** #247
**Status:** Complete
**Participants:** User, CMO, CTO, CPO

## What We're Building

Two-part feature to add a Sales domain to Soleur:

1. **PR #1: Table-driven domain routing refactor + token budget audit** -- Restructure the brainstorm command's Phase 0.5 domain detection from hardcoded blocks to a data-driven approach. Also audit and trim agent descriptions to get back under the 2500-word budget (currently at 2613 words).

2. **PR #2: Sales domain (CRO + 3 specialists)** -- Add the 6th domain with a Chief Revenue Officer (CRO) domain leader and three specialist agents covering the mid-to-bottom revenue funnel.

## Why This Approach

The CTO assessment identified that the brainstorm command's domain routing is at a maintainability threshold. At 5 domains, Phase 0.5 already has ~230 lines of copy-paste routing. Adding a 6th domain without refactoring would push it past the tipping point. The codebase itself has a comment acknowledging this: "Consider table-driven refactor at 5+ domains."

The CPO raised a valid concern: the business validation says "stop adding features." However, the refactor is infrastructure improvement (not a new feature), and the Sales domain fills a genuine funnel gap identified by the CMO -- nobody owns the MQL-to-close pipeline.

## Key Decisions

### 1. Sales vs Marketing Boundary

**Decision:** No existing agents move. Clean boundary at the demand generation / revenue conversion split.

- **Marketing owns:** Awareness, interest, demand generation (brand, SEO, content, paid media, conversion optimization, pricing tiers, retention/churn prevention)
- **Sales owns:** Pipeline management, deal progression, outbound strategy, revenue conversion and expansion

The copywriter stays in Marketing (writes copy) while the outbound-strategist (designs strategy) lives in Sales. Pricing-strategist stays in Marketing (product pricing) while deal-architect (deal-specific pricing/negotiation) lives in Sales.

### 2. Domain Leader Title

**Decision:** CRO (Chief Revenue Officer). Revenue-focused scope that covers pipeline, deals, and forecasting without overlap into Marketing's demand generation.

### 3. Sales Agent Roster

**Decision:** CRO + 3 specialists:

| Agent | Scope |
|-------|-------|
| **cro** (domain leader) | Orchestrates sales domain: assesses revenue posture, recommends pipeline actions, delegates to specialists |
| **outbound-strategist** | ICP targeting, multi-channel cadence design, lead scoring, prospecting sequences |
| **deal-architect** | Proposals, SOWs, battlecards, objection handling, discount frameworks, negotiation playbooks |
| **pipeline-analyst** | Pipeline health metrics, deal velocity, stage definitions, forecast modeling, deal reviews |

### 4. Execution Strategy

**Decision:** Two PRs.

- PR #1: Routing refactor + token audit (infrastructure)
- PR #2: Sales domain (proves the refactor by adding a domain in one table row)

### 5. Missing Domains Analysis

| Potential Domain | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Sales (CRO) | **Add** -- clear funnel gap |
| Customer Success | **Watch** -- premature without customers |
| Finance | **Watch** -- ops-advisor covers basics |
| Data/Analytics | **Skip** -- covered by existing agents |
| HR/People | **Skip** -- not core audience |

The `agents/community/` placeholder directory should be cleaned up (either populated or removed).

## Open Questions

1. **Token budget trimming targets** -- Which agent descriptions are most bloated? Needs audit during PR #1.
2. **Table-driven routing format** -- Markdown table in the command file, or inline data structure? Needs design during PR #1.
3. **Special-case workshops** -- Brand workshop and validation workshop have unique flows. How do they fit in a table-driven model? (Answer: likely as optional "workshop" entries with a handler field.)
4. **Community directory** -- Should `agents/community/` be cleaned up as part of this work or tracked separately?

## Domain Leader Assessments

### CMO Assessment
- Identified clear funnel gap: MQL-to-close pipeline is unowned
- Mapped overlap zones between existing Marketing agents and proposed Sales agents
- Recommended starting as sub-domain of Marketing (overruled -- separate domain chosen)
- Flagged Customer Success as the next most notable gap

### CTO Assessment
- Agent token budget already over limit (2613 vs 2500 words)
- Brainstorm routing at maintainability threshold
- Strongly recommended refactoring before adding domain #6
- Proposed 4-step sequence: audit descriptions, refactor routing, define scope, add domain

### CPO Assessment
- Business validation says "stop adding features"
- Only 2 genuine gaps (proposals, pipeline) in existing coverage
- Recommended against adding Sales domain (overruled -- user decided the gap is real)
- Flagged that zero external users have validated existing 50 agents
