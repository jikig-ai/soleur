# UX/UI Review Brainstorm

**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Status:** Complete
**Approach:** Prose class pattern

## What We're Building

A UX polish pass across the soleur.ai documentation site addressing content readability, visual rhythm, and brand consistency in the header.

## Problems Identified

### Critical

1. **Header logo is plain text** -- just "Soleur" in bold Inter font. No visual logo mark. The gold "S" circle (`logo-mark-512.png`) exists but is unused. Should use logo mark + wordmark.

2. **Changelog content is cramped** -- version entries (h2), subsections (h3), and bullet lists run together with minimal spacing. The `.changelog-entry` CSS class exists in `style.css` but markdown-it generates plain HTML without wrapper classes, so those styles never apply.

3. **Legal page content too wide** -- long-form legal text stretches to the full 1200px container. Paragraphs, headings, and lists lack margin. Optimal reading width for prose is ~75ch (~800px).

### Medium

4. **Getting Started page** -- same spacing issue. "Why Soleur" heading flows directly into "Installation" with no breathing room. Content section lacks vertical rhythm.

5. **Vision page** -- three dense paragraphs in the first section stack with no paragraph margin. Wall-of-text effect.

6. **Footer on mobile** -- minor crowding when stacked.

### Low

7. **"Uncategorized" pill on Skills page** -- one lonely skill in an awkward bucket.

8. **Console error on every page** -- `ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` for a Vercel analytics script reference.

### No Changes Needed

- Agents page (card grid works well)
- Skills page (same solid layout)
- Community page (clean sections)
- Legal hub page (card grid is great)
- Homepage landing (polished)
- Mobile navigation (hamburger works)

## Why This Approach

**Prose class pattern** -- add a `.prose` CSS utility class that:
- Caps content at `max-width: 75ch` for comfortable reading
- Restores proper margin between headings, paragraphs, lists
- Provides consistent vertical rhythm for long-form content
- Gets applied to changelog, legal pages, getting started, and vision prose sections

This is the simplest fix with the broadest impact. One class definition, applied across all long-form content pages.

Alternatives considered:
- **Scoped content styles** -- more CSS to maintain, each page type gets its own rules
- **Full template refactor** -- new prose.njk layout, cleaner but overkill for a CSS fix

## Key Decisions

- **Header:** Logo mark image (24px) + "Soleur" wordmark text
- **Content width:** `max-width: 75ch` (~800px) for all prose content
- **Approach:** Single `.prose` CSS class (not per-page scoped styles)
- **Scope:** Header logo + all long-form content pages (changelog, legal, getting started, vision)
- **Changelog fix:** Target `#changelog-content` in CSS since markdown-it output lacks wrapper classes

## Open Questions

None -- scope and approach are clear.
