# Legal Agents & Skills Brainstorm

**Date:** 2026-02-19
**Issue:** #114
**Status:** Decided

## What We're Building

A new **Legal** top-level domain for the Soleur plugin with two agents and two skills that generate and audit legal documents. The tools are general-purpose (usable by any Soleur plugin user for their own projects) but we dogfood them for soleur.ai's own legal pages.

### Components

1. **`legal-document-generator` agent** (`agents/legal/legal-document-generator.md`) -- Generates first-draft legal documents from company context. Supports 7 document types: Terms & Conditions, Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, GDPR Policy, Acceptable Use Policy, Data Processing Agreement, Disclaimer / Limitation of Liability. Outputs markdown.

2. **`legal-compliance-auditor` agent** (`agents/legal/legal-compliance-auditor.md`) -- Audits existing legal documents for gaps, outdated clauses, missing required disclosures, jurisdiction-specific requirements, and cross-document consistency. Produces a structured findings report with severity ratings.

3. **`legal-generate` skill** (`skills/legal-generate/SKILL.md`) -- User-facing skill that gathers company context (name, product description, data practices, jurisdiction, contact info), invokes the generator agent, and writes output. Can target markdown files or Eleventy `.njk` pages directly.

4. **`legal-audit` skill** (`skills/legal-audit/SKILL.md`) -- User-facing skill that scans a project's existing legal documents and invokes the auditor agent. Reports findings with actionable recommendations.

### Document Types Supported

| Document | Purpose | Key Sections |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Terms & Conditions | Rules for using the service | Acceptance, usage rules, IP, liability, termination |
| Privacy Policy | How user data is collected/used | Data collection, processing, rights, retention, sharing |
| Cookie Policy | Cookie usage and consent | Cookie types, purposes, management, third-party cookies |
| GDPR Policy | EU data protection compliance | Legal basis, data subject rights, DPO contact, transfers |
| Acceptable Use Policy | Permitted/prohibited uses | Prohibited activities, enforcement, reporting |
| Data Processing Agreement | B2B data processing terms | Scope, sub-processors, security measures, audit rights |
| Disclaimer / Limitation | Liability limitations | AI-specific disclaimers, warranty exclusions, indemnification |

## Why This Approach

**Two agents over one:** Follows the single-responsibility pattern established in the codebase (e.g., growth-strategist agent is separate from seo-aeo-analyst). Generation and auditing are distinct tasks with different prompting needs -- generating requires structured templates and jurisdiction awareness, while auditing requires checklist-based analysis and gap detection.

**New top-level domain over nesting:** Legal is a distinct organizational concern, not a subset of Engineering or Operations. A 5th domain (alongside Engineering, Marketing, Operations, Product) signals that legal compliance is a first-class citizen in the plugin's worldview.

**General-purpose with dogfooding:** Building for any user but validating against our own site catches usability issues early and provides a concrete reference implementation.

**No dedicated publishing agent:** Eleventy page creation is straightforward -- just a `.njk` template with content. The generate skill handles output format directly. A separate publisher agent would be YAGNI.

## Key Decisions

1. **Approach 1 selected:** Two agents (generator + auditor) + two skills. Clean separation, follows existing patterns.
2. **All 7 document types in v1:** No phasing -- full coverage from the start.
3. **Legal as 5th top-level domain:** `agents/legal/` alongside engineering, marketing, operations, product.
4. **Dogfooding model:** General-purpose tools validated against soleur.ai's own needs.
5. **Agents generate drafts, not final content:** All output includes prominent "DRAFT - Requires legal review" disclaimers. We never claim AI-generated legal text is sufficient without professional review.

## Open Questions

1. **Company context source:** Should the generator read from a structured config file (e.g., `knowledge-base/overview/company-context.md`) or gather info interactively each time? Leaning toward config file with interactive fallback.
2. **Jurisdiction defaults:** Which jurisdictions should the generator support out of the box? At minimum: US (state-level varies), EU/GDPR, UK. Others on request.
3. **Soleur.ai specifics:** What data does soleur.ai actually collect? The site is currently static with no cookies/analytics, which simplifies privacy and cookie policies significantly.
4. **Audit depth:** Should the auditor cross-reference documents against each other (e.g., privacy policy mentions cookies that aren't in the cookie policy)? Leaning yes.
