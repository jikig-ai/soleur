# Ops Directory Brainstorm

**Date:** 2026-02-13
**Issue:** #81
**Status:** Active

## What We're Building

An operations function for the Soleur project that enables AI agents to manage domains, hosting, and cost tracking. This is the first step toward the "operations" domain that was planned in the domain directory restructure but never built.

**Scope:** Establish the ops directory structure (agents, knowledge-base data files) and conventions. This is the foundation that domain purchasing, hosting setup, and cost tracking will build on.

## Why This Approach

- The "operations" domain was already planned as one of five startup functions (engineering, product, growth, operations, support) but zero components exist today
- Starting with structure and conventions first means purchase automation and browser flows have a home when they're built
- Markdown tables in knowledge-base/ops/ stay consistent with existing conventions rather than introducing YAML or JSON
- Advisory agents first, automation later -- avoids over-engineering a v1

## Key Decisions

1. **Data format:** Markdown files with structured tables in `knowledge-base/ops/` (not YAML/JSON -- stay consistent with existing conventions)
2. **Agent location:** `agents/operations/` following the recursive agent discovery pattern (e.g., `soleur:operations:cost-tracker`)
3. **Skills stay flat:** Any ops skills go under `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` per plugin loader behavior
4. **Automation level target:** Semi-autonomous with pre-approved budgets and human confirmation at payment, but v1 starts advisory-only
5. **Phased approach:** Structure first (this issue), then purchase automation, then semi-autonomous execution
6. **Starting from zero:** No existing domains, subscriptions, or costs to migrate -- clean slate

## Proposed Structure

### Agents (under `plugins/soleur/agents/operations/`)

- `cost-tracker.md` -- Reads/updates expense ledger, summarizes spending, flags renewals
- `domain-manager.md` -- Researches domain availability, compares registrars, advises on purchases
- `hosting-advisor.md` -- Compares hosting options, recommends providers based on requirements

### Knowledge-Base Data (under `knowledge-base/ops/`)

- `expenses.md` -- Markdown table ledger of all recurring and one-time costs
- `domains.md` -- Registry of owned domains, registrars, renewal dates, DNS config
- `hosting.md` -- Inventory of hosting services, providers, specs, costs

### Future Skills (not in v1)

- `domain-purchase/` -- Browser-automated domain search and guided purchase via agent-browser
- `hosting-setup/` -- Guided hosting provisioning
- `expense-report/` -- Generate cost summaries and trend reports

## Open Questions

- What registrar(s) to target first? (Cloudflare, Namecheap, Google Domains)
- Should the expense ledger track external costs too (GitHub Pro, API keys, etc.) or just infrastructure?
- How to handle budget approval -- a config file with spending limits, or per-transaction confirmation?

## Related Issues

- #75 -- `/soleur:bootstrap` skill (Operations lane overlaps with this)
- #42 -- Proactive monitoring with healthchecks.io
- #25 -- Observability alerts spawning AI agents
- #85 -- Enable GitHub Pages (website hosting)

## Phased Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (this issue)
- Create `agents/operations/` directory with advisory agents
- Create `knowledge-base/ops/` with template markdown files
- Route brainstorm command to detect ops topics

### Phase 2: Purchase Automation
- Build `domain-purchase` skill using agent-browser
- Build `hosting-setup` skill
- Add human-in-the-loop confirmation gates for payments

### Phase 3: Semi-Autonomous Ops
- Budget approval system (spending limits config)
- Automated renewal tracking and alerts
- Cost optimization recommendations
