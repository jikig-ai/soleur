# Canary probe set contract

The pre-swap canary check in `apps/web-platform/infra/ci-deploy.sh`
exists to reject a broken build BEFORE its container takes the
production port. The legacy contract (`/health` only) was insufficient
and shipped a broken bundle to prod (PR #3014 incident).

## SSR/client divergence (the load-bearing context)

`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` environment variables are inlined into the static
client bundle by Next.js's DefinePlugin at **build time**. The
`lib/supabase/client.ts` module-load validators run **only in the
browser**. So:

- A broken inlined value passes every server-side probe (`/health`,
  SSR-rendered HTML, server-render of `/dashboard` via the server
  Supabase module).
- The throw fires only after the browser parses the client bundle —
  visible to a real user, invisible to `curl`.

The probe contract below is layered specifically to close this blind
spot.

## Layered probes

| Layer | Probe | Catches | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1a | `curl http://localhost:3001/health` returns 200 | container is alive | enforced |
| 1b | `curl http://localhost:3001/login` returns 200 with non-empty body | public route renders | enforced |
| 1c | `curl http://localhost:3001/dashboard --max-redirs 0` returns 200/302/307, body does NOT contain `data-error-boundary=` | middleware redirect or successful render; rejects SSR-rendered error.tsx | enforced |
| 2 | Headless chromium hydrates `/login` AND `/dashboard`; rejects on any `pageerror`, console.error, or `Unhandled error` event during hydration | client-only throws at module load (validators, polyfill incompatibilities, encoding mismatches) | **required — was D1, promoted post-#3014** |
| 3 | `apps/web-platform/infra/canary-bundle-claim-check.sh` fetches the deployed login chunk and asserts the inlined Supabase JWT has canonical claims (`iss=supabase`, `role=anon`, ref shape) | inlined build-arg corruption (the #3007 regression class) — runs without a browser, catches what Layer 1 cannot see | enforced |

Layer 1 is the cheapest broad-coverage gate. Layer 2 is the ONLY layer
that exercises the production browser environment — including webpack's
`buffer@5.x` polyfill, which was the missing gate for the
`Buffer.from(_, "base64url")` regression class. Layer 3 covers
build-arg integrity (claim shape) but cannot detect runtime polyfill
incompatibilities. The post-#3014 incident (validator throws
`Unknown encoding: base64url` in the browser despite a canonical JWT)
forced Layer 2 from deferred to required.

## Body-content sentinel — structured marker

The shared `components/error-boundary-view.tsx` renders a stable
`data-error-boundary` attribute on the boundary container (`"root"` for
`app/error.tsx`, `"dashboard"` for `app/(dashboard)/error.tsx`). The
canary greps for `data-error-boundary=` — copy edits cannot disable the
gate. This catches **server-component** throws (which DO render error.tsx
during SSR). Client-only throws are caught by Layer 3.

## Adding a new probe

1. Add the route to the canary loop in `ci-deploy.sh`. Use the existing
   `curl --max-time 5` pattern.
2. Decide the success contract: HTTP status range AND body assertion.
3. Add a failure-mode test in `infra/ci-deploy.test.sh` (e.g.,
   `MOCK_CURL_<NAME>_5XX` env var → expect rollback trace).
4. Bump preflight Check 7 if the new probe is load-bearing for an
   incident class.

## Removing a probe

Probes are load-bearing safety nets. Removing one requires:

1. A linked PR explaining the failure class the probe was protecting
   against and how the new gate covers it.
2. Updating preflight Check 7 if the removed probe is referenced there.
3. Operator review (CTO + ops).

## Why /health alone is insufficient

`middleware.ts:18-20` short-circuits `/health` BEFORE the Supabase
session check runs. The route never imports
`@/lib/supabase/client`, so a broken inlined `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*`
value cannot affect `/health`'s response. This is why PR #3007's
broken bundle returned `200 OK` on `/health` for the entire outage
window — the canary contract said "go" and the swap proceeded.
