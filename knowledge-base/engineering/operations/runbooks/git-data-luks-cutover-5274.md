# git-data LUKS cutover runbook — #5274 Phase 3 / Sub-PR 3.D / ADR-068

Runbook for the git-data LUKS cutover route. **Today the route is a reviewer-gated, read-only proof.**
`git-data-cutover.yml` authenticates to root on the git-data host through the ADR-220 web-1 jump, reads
three facts about the store, and exits. It moves no data, repoints no mount, flips no flag and wipes no
volume. The real cutover (copy, repoint, flag flip, rollback, old-volume decommission) was removed from
`git-data-cutover.sh` because it called host mechanisms that do not exist; its rebuild is **#8211**.
Rationale and residuals: ADR-220 › "Amendment log" › "2026-09-15 (#8189)".

**No SSH in this runbook.** Every read below is a workflow annotation, a Better Stack API read or a
Sentry query. The dispatch itself uses SSH transport off the app host; you never SSH a host to check
whether it worked (`hr-no-ssh-fallback-in-runbooks`).

## Preconditions for the real cutover (all open — do not book a window)

The real cutover does not exist yet. It is blocked on all of:

- **#8211** — rebuild the real modes on real mechanisms (freeze model, same-version redeploy, rollback
  split, `web-1-swap` membership, the endpoint guard for the copy).
- **#8209** — evict the repo-secret-reachable credentials from `prd_terraform` (its own ADR).
- **#7226** — pin git-data's SSH host key. Until then every store-probe answer is unauthenticated.
- A fresh `git-data-host-replace` plus a `GIT_DATA_LUKS_KEY` rotation immediately before the real
  cutover, so nothing planted during the read-only period survives into it (ADR-220 D6).
- The legal-activation dependencies on the roadmap row for #5274 (Article 30 PA-36, #8101, #8094).

A dispatch that asks for a real mode refuses with `verdict=real_cutover_unreconciled` (exit 5) before
any remote call.

## What the read-only dispatch does

`git-data-cutover.yml` (`workflow_dispatch`, input `confirm=CUTOVER-GIT-DATA`, from `main`). One job,
`cutover`, behind the `web-platform-infra-apply` environment approval. The whole run holds the
`git-data-state` concurrency group, so it never overlaps a git-data replace, birth or rehearsal.

1. Confirm token.
2. **Flag precheck** (`git-data-flag-precheck.sh`, the only step holding the `prd` read token). A read
   error refuses `verdict=flag_read_failed`; `GIT_DATA_STORE_ENABLED=true` refuses
   `verdict=flag_already_true`. Both exit 5.
3. **Secrets present.** An empty `DOPPLER_TOKEN_GIT_DATA_ROOT` refuses `verdict=git_data_root_token_absent`.
4. CF tunnel bridge to web-1.
5. **Key fetch** from the isolated Doppler project `soleur-git-data-root`. A failure refuses
   `verdict=git_data_root_key_fetch_failed reason=<rc_nonzero|empty|not_openssh_key>`.
6. `ssh_config` writer (literal jump target, `IdentitiesOnly`, no forwarding).
7. **Script.** The access gate (`role=web`, `role=git-data-jump`, `role=git-data-auth`; exit 3 on any
   non-ok), then three fail-closed store probes (exit 5): `old_store_unmounted`, `already_cut_over`,
   `store_not_empty`, or `probe_failed` when a probe answer does not validate.
8. Teardown, always.

Exit 0 means: root authenticated end to end, the plaintext store is mounted from a device that is not
the LUKS mapper, and it holds zero repositories. While #7226 is open a compromised web-1 could forge
that answer (ADR-220 D4).

Read the annotations without a dashboard:
`gh api repos/jikig-ai/soleur/check-runs/<job-id>/annotations --jq '.[].message'`, with the job id from
`gh run view <run-id> --json jobs --jq '.jobs[0].databaseId'`.

## Post-merge order (#8189)

Each prod step needs explicit authorization for that step. A menu acknowledgement does not count
(`hr-menu-option-ack-not-prod-write-auth`).

1. **Root-key apply.** Dispatch `apply-git-data-root-key.yml` from `main` with its typed confirm token,
   then approve the environment. It refuses any plan that is not create, read or no-op, and prints the
   key's `SHA256:` fingerprint. Any non-success emails ops through `notify-root-key-apply`.
2. **Fingerprint PR.** A PR commits the printed value to
   `apps/web-platform/infra/git-data-root-key.fingerprint` and merges.
3. **Replace.** Dispatch `apply-web-platform-infra.yml` from `main` with
   `apply_target=git-data-host-replace`. The replace gate's `git_data_root_key_arm` must pass. This is
   the only way the key reaches the host.
4. **Private-NIC readiness read** (below). It must read `up`.
5. **Dry run.** Dispatch `git-data-cutover.yml` from `main` and approve. It must read
   `role=git-data-auth verdict=ok`, clear all three store probes, and exit 0.

### Private-NIC readiness read (step 4)

`web-git-data-probe.sh` runs on web-1 every 60 s. On a successful bounded TCP connect to `10.0.1.20:22`
over the private network, it pings the `soleur-git-data-prd` heartbeat (`betteruptime_heartbeat.git_data_prd`
in `git-data.tf`, period 60 s, grace 180 s). A green read proves the fresh host's private NIC is up and
its sshd port answers. It does **not** prove that git transport serves or that the root key was
delivered; the dry run proves that.

Read it no earlier than 4 minutes (period plus grace) after the replace run completed
(`gh run view <run-id> --json conclusion,updatedAt`), so a beat from before the replace cannot account
for `up`:

```bash
curl -fsS -H "Authorization: Bearer $(doppler secrets get BETTERSTACK_API_TOKEN_READONLY --plain -p soleur -c prd_terraform)" \
  'https://uptime.betterstack.com/api/v2/heartbeats?per_page=250' \
  | jq '.data[] | select(.attributes.name == "soleur-git-data-prd") | {id, status: .attributes.status, paused: .attributes.paused}'
```

- `up` — proceed to the dry run.
- `down` — the fresh host's private NIC or sshd is not up. A fresh Hetzner host can boot with its
  private NIC down (learning `2026-07-07-immutable-redeploy.md`). Re-dispatch the replace; both volumes
  are retained.
- `paused` — the heartbeat is not armed, so this read proves nothing. Arming is
  `arm-heartbeats.sh --arm` inside `apply-web-platform-infra.yml`, and it skips an address absent from
  state. Rely on the dry run's `role=git-data-jump` verdict for L3 instead.

## Verdict map

| Where you are | What the run reads |
|---|---|
| Before the root-key apply | `verdict=git_data_root_token_absent` |
| Before the fingerprint PR merged, or the Hetzner key object deleted or swapped | the replace or birth gate refuses `verdict=git_data_root_key_not_in_create reason=<fingerprint_file_missing\|data_source_absent\|key_count\|name\|fingerprint\|server_keys>` |
| Token revoked, or the Doppler secret missing or malformed | `verdict=git_data_root_key_fetch_failed reason=<rc_nonzero\|empty\|not_openssh_key>` |
| **L3** — the host is down, or its private NIC or sshd is not up | `role=git-data-jump verdict=failed reason=timeout\|no_route\|connect_refused` |
| web-1's sshd stopped permitting `direct-tcpip` | `role=git-data-jump verdict=failed reason=forward_refused` |
| **L7** — the key has not been delivered yet (replace not run) | `role=git-data-auth verdict=failed reason=auth_refused` |
| **L7** — after a key rotation, until the next replace | `role=git-data-auth verdict=failed reason=auth_refused` |
| Flag read failed, or the flag is already on | `verdict=flag_read_failed` / `verdict=flag_already_true` (exit 5) |
| Store not mounted, already on the mapper, not empty, or an unvalidated probe answer | `verdict=old_store_unmounted` / `already_cut_over` / `store_not_empty` / `probe_failed` (exit 5) |
| A stale invocation asking for a real mode | `verdict=real_cutover_unreconciled` (exit 5) |

L3 and L7 are different faults: L3 is reachability (NIC, sshd, host), L7 is authorization (the key).
Read the private-NIC heartbeat before treating an L7 verdict as a key problem.

## Sharp edges

- **A pending approval holds `git-data-state`.** A cutover or root-key apply run waiting for its
  environment approval holds the group. A replace dispatched meanwhile waits while holding
  `terraform-apply-web-platform-host`, which stalls web-platform applies. Approve, reject or cancel the
  pending run before you dispatch a replace.
- **A newer queued run cancels an older pending one (#8167).** GitHub keeps one pending run per
  concurrency group. A run that ends `cancelled` without executing a step was displaced, not refused.
  Re-dispatch it once the group's current holder has finished.
- **A re-run asks for approval again.** The environment sits on the job that reads the key.

## What users see during the replace

- **Web requests: nothing.** With `GIT_DATA_STORE_ENABLED` off, provision, replicate and fetch return
  before touching git-data (`apps/web-platform/server/git-data-replication.ts`).
- **Settings → Delete Account completes**, but each deletion during the window can wait up to the
  30 s timeout in `removeGitDataRepo` and logs an Art. 17 erasure-failure Sentry event
  (`feature:account-delete`, `op:git-data-bare-repo-erasure`). No repository exists yet, so nothing is
  left behind. These events are expected for the window, and only for the window: one outside a replace
  window is a real finding.
- The `soleur-git-data-prd` heartbeat reads `down` for the window.

## Breach-triage trigger

Open an incident (`/soleur:incident`) and route it to the CLO for an Art. 33 assessment when any of
these is seen:

- a run log or artifact showing root-key material;
- a reference to `DOPPLER_TOKEN_GIT_DATA_ROOT` outside the `cutover` job;
- an unexplained change to the Hetzner key labelled `soleur-role=git-data-root`, or a create gate
  refusing `reason=fingerprint` or `reason=key_count`;
- a `git-data-root-key` state object or `soleur-git-data-root` Doppler access that no dispatch explains.

Before any repository exists, a leaked root key already reaches the host's own Doppler token
(`prd_git_data`, #6167). Once repositories exist, a leak is likely an Art. 33 event (ADR-220 D4).

## Multi-host DNS rewire

Not part of the read-only proof. `cloudflare_record.app` (`dns.tf`) stays single-host until the
ADR-068 Phase-3 GA flip, which also brings the out-of-band second web host into rotation (ADR-143 D2).
That rewire is sequenced by #8211 together with the real cutover; the design constraint stays recorded
in the `dns.tf` header.

## After the real cutover (owned by #8211)

These stay recorded for the rebuild; none applies to the read-only proof.

- **Verification (observability only).** Sentry `feature:control_plane_route level:error` = 0 (after
  confirming healthy placement events exist), `feature:worktree_lease level:error` = 0,
  `feature:git-data-authz cross_tenant:true` = 0 (a `level:warning` tag). The `soleur-git-data-prd`
  heartbeat reads `up` through the API read above.
- **Backstop: `origin` is a strict subset of git-data.** `replicateToGitData` force-pushes all refs,
  while `syncPush` commits only `knowledge-base/**` and reroutes protected pushes. After any rollback, do
  not decommission the LUKS volume until git-data-only writes are reconciled.
- **Soak follow-through (gates GA close).** ≥7 days with zero fence false-rejects, zero cross-tenant
  denials and zero `control_plane_route` failures, via
  `scripts/followthroughs/phase3-ga-soak-5274.sh` and a `follow-through` tracker
  (`followthrough-convention.md`), whose directive carries `secrets=SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`. When it closes,
  ADR-068 moves `adopting` → `accepted`.
