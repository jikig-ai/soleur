# Plan: in-place signed redelivery channel for the dedicated Inngest host (#6780)

## Overview

Build a **pull-based signed config-refresh channel** so a change to a host-executed
`apps/web-platform/infra/*.sh` script reaches the dedicated Inngest host
(`soleur-inngest-prd`, 10.0.1.40, deny-all-public) **without** an
`apply_target=inngest-host-replace` of the sole production scheduler. A systemd timer on
the host resolves a **promoted digest pointer** (`INNGEST_CONFIG_DIGEST` in Doppler
`soleur-inngest/prd`), pulls a **cosign-static-key-signed OCI bundle** of the refresh-set,
verifies (signature + per-file sha256 manifest + monotonic version gate), applies
**atomically/fail-closed** through the existing `infra-config-install.sh` STDIN root helper,
and reports **off-box** to Better Stack via the baked `inngest-boot-phone-home.sh`, paired
with an absence-heartbeat monitor. The host-side machinery is baked into
`cloud-init-inngest.yml` and therefore **rides the #6178 cutover provision** (bootstrap
paradox: the channel installs only through the replace it eliminates); the CI
build/sign/promote workflow and future bundle edits then flow through the channel itself.

Design is settled from the brainstorm (11 decisions). This plan is the HOW. Keyless cosign is
ruled out (ADR-052 blocks Fulcio/Rekor egress); signing is a **static key** extending ADR-087
(air-gapped verify) + ADR-128 (digest-pinned coherence) + ADR-096 (zot-first/GHCR-fallback).

## Research Reconciliation — Spec vs. Codebase

| Spec/brainstorm claim | Reality (verified vs `feat-6780…` worktree) | Plan response |
|---|---|---|
| Reuse `infra-config-install.sh` verbatim | Exists; STDIN payload (#4827), **15 hardcoded** dests in `DEST_SPEC`, `rc=3`, mode/owner from the table not caller (`:59-88`) | Reuse the helper, but the refresh-set scripts must be **added to `DEST_SPEC`** (+ its `FILE_MAP` lockstep). Phase 4 task. |
| Off-box marker via `inngest-boot-phone-home.sh` | NOT a standalone infra file — baked in `cloud-init-inngest.yml` `write_files:114`, used across boot stages | Emit a new marker verb through the SAME baked script; no new emitter. |
| Add `INNGEST_CONFIG_DIGEST` to isolation self-check (5→6) | Confirmed at `cloud-init-inngest.yml:315-333`: regex `^(INNGEST_(SIGNING_KEY\|EVENT_KEY\|REDIS_PASSWORD\|POSTGRES_URI\|HEARTBEAT_URL)\|BETTERSTACK_LOGS_TOKEN)$`, floor `-lt 5`, **AND `n_total -ne n_inngest` (exact-set)**. The `-lt 5` is a *lower bound*: dark=5, live=6 (`INNGEST_HEARTBEAT_URL` arrives only at cutover). | The **exact-set** `n_total -ne n_inngest` is the real gate. Extend the regex alternation to include the pointer; the floor is dark/live-timing-dependent — **do NOT flatly bump to `-lt 6`** (bricks dark boot if the pointer is cutover-only). See **DEC-FLOOR** below: decide whether `INNGEST_CONFIG_DIGEST` is dark-present (TF-provisioned pre-cutover, floor→6) or cutover-only (floor stays 5, exact-set count rises). |
| Publish to zot too, GHCR fallback (operator) | Web-host zot-first pull (`cloud-init.yml:507-520`, ADR-096) authenticates with `ZOT_*` from Doppler **soleur/prd**. The dedicated host's Doppler is the **isolated soleur-inngest/prd**, whose self-check **FATALs on any foreign secret**. | **Publish-to-both is unconditional (CI side).** Host **zot-first pull** requires `ZOT_*` admitted into `soleur-inngest/prd` → isolation floor grows further (6→~9). See **Decision D-ZOT** below — recommend GHCR-direct host pull in v1, zot-first host pull as a flagged fast-follow. |
| cosign verify on the dedicated host | The dedicated host **digest-pins only**; it does not cosign-verify its bootstrap image today (`cloud-init-inngest.yml:390` is `@sha256` pinned). `cosign verify` exists on the app-deploy path (`ci-deploy.sh`, ADR-087). | cosign-verify-blob is **net-new capability on this host** — bake the cosign binary + baked trusted public key. Tooling/pattern exists (ADR-087, `cosign-trusted-root.json`). |
| Four pin sites untouched | Confirmed: `cloud-init.yml:699/705` (web IREF/ZIREF), `cloud-init-inngest.yml:390` (dedicated IREF@sha256), `inngest-bootstrap.sh:492` (comment). Coupled by the `vinngest-v*` semver-max guard. | Config bundle is a **distinct artifact** from the bootstrap image → the four pins are out of scope (Non-Goal). |

## User-Brand Impact

**If this lands broken, the user experiences:** the sole Inngest scheduler runs stale or no host
scripts — the host that fires every statutory-deadline / notification cron — so a user's
deadline reminder or notification silently never fires, OR a dead refresh timer masks an
undelivered fix.
**If this leaks / is subverted, the user's workflow is exposed via:** an unsigned/forged/rolled-back
bundle executing arbitrary code on the sole scheduler (RCE) — full compromise of the host that
touches user-facing cron delivery.
**Brand-survival threshold:** single-user incident.

`requires_cpo_signoff: true`. CPO sign-off is required at plan time (tiered model: framing done at
brainstorm, locked here). The brainstorm spawned CTO + platform-strategist + infra-security (not
CPO/CLO) because this is pure internal infra with no product/legal surface — **CPO sign-off to be
confirmed at the plan-review confirmation gate**; `user-impact-reviewer` runs at PR review.

## Decision D-ZOT (User-Challenge — surface at confirmation gate)

The operator chose "publish to Zot as well, GHCR fallback." Publishing to both registries in CI is
free and unconditional. The **host-side zot-first pull**, however, requires `ZOT_REGISTRY_URL/USER/TOKEN`
in the **isolated** `soleur-inngest/prd`, which grows the boot isolation self-check floor from 6 to ~9
and widens the isolated-credential surface on the sole scheduler.

- **Recommended (v1):** CI publishes the signed bundle to **both zot + GHCR**; the **host pulls GHCR-direct
  by digest** (matching how it already pulls its bootstrap image — no new isolated-Doppler secrets, no
  further isolation-floor growth). File **host zot-first pull** as a flagged fast-follow (its own task)
  once `ZOT_*` admission into the isolated project is designed.
- **Alternative (operator literal):** host pulls **zot-first → GHCR fallback** in v1 → include the
  `ZOT_*` admission + isolation-floor bump (6→~9) as Phase 3 work.

This diverges from a literal reading of the operator's answer, so it is surfaced, not silently applied
(ADR-084). Confirm at the apply gate.

## Plan-Review Hardening (P0/P1 — binding; from architecture + spec-flow + security-sentinel)

These are load-bearing constraints the implementation MUST satisfy; each maps to a new AC/test.

- **HARD-1 (TCB boundary — P0).** The channel **engine** — the verify+apply script (`inngest-config-refresh.sh`), the cosign binary, the baked public verify key, the `.timer`/`.service` units, and the `applied.version` file — MUST NOT be members of the refresh-set or `DEST_SPEC`/`FILE_MAP`. They change **only** via host replace. Otherwise one validly-signed bundle replaces the verifier with an accept-all shim (signed-once → bypass-forever). Test-assert these paths are absent from `DEST_SPEC`.
- **HARD-2 (version is a SIGNED field — P0).** The monotonic version integer MUST live **inside the cosign-signed bytes** (e.g., a `VERSION` line in the signed manifest) and be read **only after** `cosign verify-blob` succeeds — never from an OCI tag/annotation or the Doppler pointer. Otherwise a registry/pointer writer replays an old-but-validly-signed (since-patched) bundle under a forged-high version. Test: old-signed bundle re-published at a higher pointer version is still rejected.
- **HARD-3 (`applied.version` seed + ownership — P1).** cloud-init MUST seed `applied.version` to the baked floor's version at bake time (shared numbering space with the bundle), and create `/var/lib/inngest-config` + the version file **`root:root`** (NOT under the deploy-writable `/var/lib/inngest` which is `deploy:deploy`). Absent seeding → downgrade below the running floor; deploy-writable → a deploy-user (the identity inngest runs as) resets the floor and forces a downgrade. Test ownership/mode + fresh-host first-pull.
- **HARD-4 (run as root — P1).** The verify+apply `.service` runs `User=root` (baked, root-owned); it invokes `infra-config-install` directly (no deploy→sudoers grant). Keep the deploy sudoers grant to the existing webhook path only. The verifier must not execute in a deploy-writable `$PATH`/tempdir.
- **HARD-5 (set-atomic apply — P1).** `infra-config-install.sh` is **per-file** atomic, not set-atomic. Stage+verify ALL files, then swap all; advance `applied.version` **only after the last file lands**; on mid-set failure, re-apply next tick (do not latch a torn mixed-version set). Add a generation marker crons can read to refuse a mixed set.
- **HARD-6 (promotion credential — P1).** Promotion writes `INNGEST_CONFIG_DIGEST` via **`terraform apply` of the `doppler_secret`** (no standing CI write-token into the isolated `soleur-inngest/prd`), OR the write-token surface is explicitly justified in ADR-133. The signing principal and the promotion principal SHOULD be distinct (no single job both signs and promotes).
- **HARD-7 (CI = total-compromise root — P1).** ADR-133 names CI-workflow compromise as the top residual RCE path (whoever compromises the release workflow can sign + promote a fresh bundle; the monotonic gate does nothing against a *fresh* forgery). Gate the cosign private key behind a GitHub **environment with a non-empty required-reviewer set**, OIDC-scoped, protected branch. Name the cosign key distinctly (`COSIGN_CONFIG_SIGNING_KEY`), in the CI/`soleur/prd` project only — NEVER the isolated project.
- **HARD-8 (drift comparator is a deliverable — P1).** The absence-heartbeat only catches a *dead* timer, and the baked floor's own boot marker can *satisfy* it while the delta never pulled. Ship a concrete off-box comparator (a CI/cron job reads the Doppler pointer + queries Better Stack for the latest `APPLIED` marker, alarms on `applied_digest ≠ pointer` beyond N windows). The boot-floor marker MUST be distinguishable (`version=floor`) so it does not mask a stuck delta.
- **HARD-9 (pointer-below-floor inversion — P1).** If a cutover bakes a floor whose version exceeds the last-promoted pointer, the first pull is rejected forever → silent stale. Gate promotion to require `pointer.version > baked-floor.version`, AND emit an explicit alarm when a pull is rejected as ≤ current (rejection-as-signal, not silent no-op).
- **HARD-10 (fail-closed arms — P1).** The verify+apply script MUST NOT inherit the bootstrap's ambient `set +e` / `|| true`. Each gate is explicit fail-closed: `cosign verify-blob` rc≠0, `sha256sum -c` rc≠0, a **missing/non-integer** `applied.version` (fail-closed to a hard floor, never parse-to-0-accept-all), `infra-config-install` `rc=3`. Logging/phone-home may `|| true`; a *decision* behind `|| true` may not.
- **HARD-11 (runbook channel-live precondition — P1).** The runbook is INVALID pre-cutover (promoting a pointer no host reads = believing a fix shipped when it silently didn't). Gate it on a "channel-live" assertion (a fresh `SOLEUR_INFRA_PULL_APPLIED` marker exists post-cutover) and add the #6178-scheduled linkage or a loud "channel not yet live" state.
- **HARD-12 (Phase-0 evidence — P2→gates P1s).** Verify the baked GHCR creds can pull the **config-bundle OCI repo** specifically (not just the bootstrap-image repo) — a repo-scope mismatch 401s every pull → permanent fail-closed. `infra-config-install.sh` is NOT currently baked in `cloud-init-inngest.yml`; it must be newly baked, root-invoked-only, WITHOUT importing the web-host webhook/sudoers apparatus. Note the shared-`DEST_SPEC` cross-host widening (every refresh-set dest becomes grantable on web hosts too).

## Implementation Phases (contract-first ordering)

**Phase 0 — Preconditions & enumeration (verify, no code).**
- Enumerate the exact host-executed `*.sh` refresh-set on 10.0.1.40 (OQ2): the scripts that run ON the
  dedicated host vs web-host-only. Source of truth = `cloud-init-inngest.yml` `write_files`/`runcmd` +
  `inngest-bootstrap.sh` references.
- Confirm host egress reachability for the chosen substrate: the boot self-check already runs
  `doppler run --project soleur-inngest --config prd` at boot, so `api.doppler.com` + GHCR (baked creds)
  are proven; record the evidence in the plan.
- Audit the `DEST_SPEC`/`FILE_MAP` gap in `infra-config-install.sh` for the refresh-set dests.

**Phase 1 — ADR-133 + C4 (architectural decision is a deliverable).**
- Author `ADR-133-pull-based-signed-config-refresh-for-dedicated-inngest-host.md` via `/soleur:architecture`:
  the new trust boundary + pull control channel; carves the `*.sh`-only exception to the image-replace-only
  rule; extends ADR-087 (verify), ADR-128 (digest coherence), ADR-096 (zot). Status: `adopting` (true after
  the cutover provision lands). Re-verify the next-free ordinal at ship (Collision Gate).
- C4: read all three `.c4` files; add the CI **signer** (external system, `#external`), the
  **zot/GHCR registry** edge to the inngest host if not modeled, and the config-refresh relationship
  (CI → registry → host). Run `c4-code-syntax.test.ts` + `c4-render.test.ts`.

**Phase 2 — CI build + cosign-static-key sign + publish (producer contract).**
- Provision a **cosign static keypair**: private key → Doppler `prd` (CI-only, `TF_VAR`/CI secret);
  **public verify key committed** for baking. Rotation recipe mirrors ADR-087 trusted-root re-capture
  (accept both public keys during overlap → cut CI → drop old) — OQ4.
- New workflow (`.github/workflows/*.yml`): package refresh-set + per-file sha256 **manifest** + a
  **monotonic version** into a bundle; `cosign sign-blob` with the static key; publish the OCI artifact to
  **both zot and GHCR**. (`workflow_dispatch` for a new workflow cannot be verified from a feature branch —
  wire the build as a job in an existing `pull_request` workflow OR test the packaging logic as a
  locally-runnable script; do NOT plan a temporary `workflow_dispatch` test workflow.)

**Phase 3 — Promoted digest pointer + isolation self-check (contract).**
- Add `INNGEST_CONFIG_DIGEST` to `soleur-inngest/prd` via the `inngest-betterstack-token.tf` `doppler_secret`
  pattern (copy into `soleur/prd_terraform` for `TF_VAR` → verify read-only → apply). Digest published
  **only on promotion** (D7): a CI gate / short soak after landing on main advances the pointer; never
  raw main-latest.
- Extend the boot isolation self-check (`cloud-init-inngest.yml:317-325`): add `INNGEST_CONFIG_DIGEST` to
  the regex alternation and bump the floor `-lt 5` → `-lt 6`. **(If D-ZOT alternative chosen: also admit
  `ZOT_REGISTRY_URL/USER/TOKEN` → regex + floor → ~9.)**

**Phase 4 — Host verify+apply script + systemd timer/service + cosign pubkey (consumer; RIDES #6178 cutover).**
- Bake into `cloud-init-inngest.yml`: (a) the cosign binary + baked public verify key; (b) the verify+apply
  script (resolve digest from Doppler → pull `@sha256` GHCR-direct [v1] → `cosign verify-blob --key <pub>` →
  verify per-file sha256 vs manifest → **monotonic version gate** [reject ≤ last-applied, persisted at
  `/var/lib/inngest-config/applied.version`] → atomic stage+swap via `infra-config-install.sh`); (c) a
  systemd `.service` + `.timer` (cadence per OQ3). Add refresh-set dests to `DEST_SPEC`/`FILE_MAP`.
- Fail-closed: any verify/version/fetch failure keeps last-known-good, touches no live script, emits the
  off-box fail marker.

**Phase 5 — Off-box observability.**
- Marker verbs through `inngest-boot-phone-home.sh`: `SOLEUR_INFRA_PULL_APPLIED version=… sha256=… verify=ok`
  every run; `SOLEUR_INFRA_PULL_VERIFY_FAIL …` on failure.
- Terraform: a Better Stack **absence-heartbeat** monitor (alerts on missing refresh — the #6536 lesson) +
  an `OnFailure=` Sentry-Crons/Resend alarm (mirror `cron-egress-alarm.sh`). Off-box **audit**: host state
  file `{applied_version, bundle_sha256, signer_keyid, per_file_sha256[], applied_ts, verify_result}` read
  via a `cat-infra-config-state.sh`-style reader; applied digest cross-checkable against the CI-logged
  signed-artifact digest.

**Phase 6 — Tests + runbook.**
- `.test.sh` (mirror `inngest-host.test.sh` convention): verify the isolation-check regex+floor change; the
  monotonic gate rejects a lower version; fail-closed keeps last-known-good; the cosign-verify arm rejects an
  unsigned/wrong-key bundle; the `DEST_SPEC` additions. Deterministic invocation (no LLM, no live prod writes).
- Runbook: how to ship a host-script change (edit `*.sh` → CI signs+publishes → promote the pointer →
  timer applies → verify off-box via `betterstack-query.sh`), the batching/promotion cadence, and the
  rotation recipe.

## Files to Create
- `.github/workflows/<inngest-config-bundle>.yml` (or a job in an existing workflow) — build+sign+publish.
- `apps/web-platform/infra/inngest-config-refresh.sh` — host verify+apply script (baked via cloud-init).
- `apps/web-platform/infra/inngest-config-pubkey.pem` (or embedded in cloud-init) — cosign public verify key.
- `apps/web-platform/infra/inngest-config-digest.tf` — `doppler_secret` for `INNGEST_CONFIG_DIGEST` (mirror `inngest-betterstack-token.tf`).
- `apps/web-platform/infra/inngest-config-refresh.test.sh` — host-side tests.
- `knowledge-base/engineering/architecture/decisions/ADR-133-*.md`.
- Runbook under `knowledge-base/engineering/operations/runbooks/`.

## Files to Edit
- `apps/web-platform/infra/cloud-init-inngest.yml` — timer/service/pubkey/verify-apply bake; isolation self-check regex+floor.
- `apps/web-platform/infra/infra-config-install.sh` — `DEST_SPEC` + `FILE_MAP` refresh-set dests.
- `apps/web-platform/infra/inngest-host.tf` — Better Stack absence-heartbeat monitor; any nft/egress note (no new inbound).
- `.c4` model/views/spec — signer + registry→host edges.
- `README`/counts as applicable (none expected — no plugin component).

## Infrastructure (IaC)

### Terraform changes
- `inngest-config-digest.tf` (`doppler_secret` for `INNGEST_CONFIG_DIGEST`, `soleur-inngest/prd`); Better
  Stack absence-heartbeat monitor in `inngest-host.tf` (gate on `var.betterstack_paid_tier` if the monitor
  type requires it — vendor-tier reality check). Sensitive vars: cosign private key (CI/Doppler `prd`, never
  on host); `INNGEST_CONFIG_DIGEST` value (Doppler-managed).
### Apply path
- **cloud-init + `inngest-host-replace`** for the host-side bake (it rides the #6178 cutover provision — the
  ONLY time the host is (re)born). Non-host Terraform (the `doppler_secret`, the monitor) applies via the
  normal `apply-web-platform-infra.yml` path. No standalone host replace is spent solely to add the channel.
### Distinctness / drift safeguards
- Deny-all-public preserved (no new inbound; the timer is outbound-only). The digest pointer is the only
  mutable control input; cosign signature + monotonic version + per-file sha256 bound its authority.
### Vendor-tier reality check
- Confirm the Better Stack absence-heartbeat/monitor type is available on the current tier before `apply`
  (mirror the `betteruptime_policy` free-tier gate pattern).

## Observability

```yaml
liveness_signal:
  what: SOLEUR_INFRA_PULL_APPLIED marker (version + applied sha256) every timer run
  cadence: every timer tick (OQ3)
  alert_target: Better Stack absence-heartbeat monitor (alarms on MISSING refresh)
  configured_in: cloud-init-inngest.yml (emit) + inngest-host.tf (monitor)
error_reporting:
  destination: Better Stack (SOLEUR_INFRA_PULL_VERIFY_FAIL) + Sentry-Crons/Resend OnFailure
  fail_loud: true (fail-closed keeps last-known-good AND emits off-box alarm)
failure_modes:
  - {mode: bad/missing signature, detection: cosign verify-blob non-zero → VERIFY_FAIL marker, alert_route: Better Stack + OnFailure}
  - {mode: version rollback/replay, detection: monotonic gate reject → VERIFY_FAIL marker, alert_route: Better Stack}
  - {mode: manifest sha mismatch, detection: per-file sha256 compare fail → VERIFY_FAIL marker, alert_route: Better Stack}
  - {mode: dead timer (silent), detection: Better Stack absence-heartbeat (no APPLIED marker in window), alert_route: Better Stack}
  - {mode: stale re-baked floor (#6594), detection: applied-digest marker vs promoted pointer drift, alert_route: Better Stack}
logs:
  where: journald → vector → Better Stack; host state file /var/lib/inngest-config/
  retention: Better Stack default
discoverability_test:
  command: bash scripts/betterstack-query.sh --grep SOLEUR_INFRA_PULL_APPLIED   # NO ssh
  expected_output: a marker line with version= and sha256= within the last timer window
```

## Architecture Decision (ADR/C4)
### ADR
- **Create ADR-133** (provisional) — pull-based signed config-refresh for the dedicated Inngest host.
  Extends ADR-087 / ADR-128 / ADR-096; carves the `*.sh`-only in-place exception to image-replace-only.
### C4 views
- Container/Component: add the CI **signer** (`#external`), the **config artifact** flow through
  zot/GHCR to the inngest host, and the **refresh** relationship. Edit `.c4` directly; run the C4 tests.
### Sequencing
- ADR authored now with `status: adopting`; true once the cutover provision bakes the channel.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Pre-merge (PR)
- [ ] AC1: `cloud-init-inngest.yml` isolation self-check includes `INNGEST_CONFIG_DIGEST` in the regex AND floor `-lt 6` (grep-assert both).
- [ ] AC2: The host verify+apply script (a) `cosign verify-blob --key`s before apply, (b) rejects version ≤ last-applied, (c) verifies per-file sha256 vs manifest, (d) applies only via `infra-config-install.sh` (no arbitrary dest). `.test.sh` asserts each arm.
- [ ] AC3: A bundle failing verify/version/manifest leaves live scripts untouched AND emits `SOLEUR_INFRA_PULL_VERIFY_FAIL` (test asserts fail-closed).
- [ ] AC4: No new inbound rule added to the inngest host nftables (grep the nft set; deny-all-public preserved).
- [ ] AC5: The CI workflow signs with the static key and publishes to **both** zot and GHCR; the public verify key is committed and baked.
- [ ] AC6: `INNGEST_CONFIG_DIGEST` `doppler_secret` + monitor `terraform plan` shows only the intended adds (no create of `hcloud_server`/host, no destroy).
- [ ] AC7: ADR-133 exists with the four required headings; C4 tests green; `.c4` renders the new signer/registry/host edges.
- [ ] AC8: `PR body uses Ref #6780` (NOT Closes — the channel is only proven after it rides the #6178 cutover provision; close #6780 post-cutover with off-box marker evidence).
- [ ] AC10 (HARD-1): a test asserts the engine paths (`inngest-config-refresh.sh`, cosign binary, pubkey, `.timer`/`.service`, `applied.version`) are NOT in `DEST_SPEC`/`FILE_MAP`.
- [ ] AC11 (HARD-2): a test asserts an old-signed bundle re-published under a higher pointer/annotation version is REJECTED (version read only from the verified signed bytes).
- [ ] AC12 (positive apply-path, spec-flow #1): a test asserts that after a valid higher-version bundle, on-disk file content changed AND `applied.version` advanced — not merely that a marker was emitted.
- [ ] AC13 (HARD-3): a test asserts `/var/lib/inngest-config` + `applied.version` are `root:root`, and fresh-host first-pull applies the delta above the seeded floor.
- [ ] AC14 (HARD-5): a test asserts a mid-set apply failure leaves NO torn mixed-version set (stage-all-then-swap-all; `applied.version` advances only after the last file).
- [ ] AC15 (HARD-10, replaces flat AC3): per-arm fail-closed tests — unsigned, wrong-key, sha-mismatch, lower-version, corrupt/empty `applied.version`, empty/truncated bundle — each keeps last-known-good AND emits `SOLEUR_INFRA_PULL_VERIFY_FAIL`.
- [ ] AC16 (HARD-4): the verify+apply `.service` runs `User=root`, no deploy→sudoers grant for this unit.
- [ ] AC17 (AC5 round-trip, spec-flow #3): a test signs with the CI static key and verifies with the committed/baked pubkey in the same test (catches key-A-sign / key-B-bake mismatch).
- [ ] AC18 (spec-flow #13): a test asserts every refresh-set dest resolves in BOTH `DEST_SPEC` and `FILE_MAP` with matching mode/owner (lockstep).
- [ ] AC19 (HARD-8): the off-box drift comparator exists (reads pointer + latest `APPLIED` marker, alarms on divergence); the boot-floor marker is distinguishable (`version=floor`).

### Post-merge (operator / follow-through)
- [ ] AC9 ⏳: after the #6178 cutover provision bakes the channel, a host-script edit → CI sign+publish → pointer promote → timer applies, verified by `SOLEUR_INFRA_PULL_APPLIED` reaching Better Stack (off-box). Enroll as a **follow-through** (soak) with a verification script under `scripts/followthroughs/` — `/ship` Phase 5.5 gate.

## Domain Review

**Domains relevant:** Engineering (carry-forward from brainstorm).

### Engineering
**Status:** reviewed (carry-forward). **Assessment:** CTO — minimal delta over machinery the host already
runs; config bundle distinct from the four image pins; hazards = RCE (→cosign + dest allowlist) and
#6594/#6536 latched-false-green (→monotonic gate + off-box applied-digest + absence-heartbeat); rides the
cutover provision. platform-strategist — GHCR-direct is the host's proven pull path (no zot branch today);
Doppler-digest aligns ADR-128; isolation self-check +1 (or +ZOT). infra-security — asymmetric static-key
(not shared HMAC), cosign keyless out (ADR-052), verify-before-activate + atomic swap + dest allowlist +
monotonic version; fail-closed keeps last-known-good + off-box alarm, never SSH.

### Product/UX Gate
Not applicable — no UI-surface file in Files to Create/Edit (pure infra/CI). Tier: NONE.

## Open Questions (for deepen-plan / confirmation)
1. **D-ZOT** (above) — host zot-first pull (isolation floor 6→~9) vs GHCR-direct v1 + zot fast-follow. **Recommend v1 GHCR-direct.**
2. **DEC-FLOOR** (from plan-review) — is `INNGEST_CONFIG_DIGEST` **dark-present** (TF-provisioned pre-cutover → floor moves to 6) or **cutover-only** like `HEARTBEAT_URL` (floor stays 5, exact-set count rises at cutover)? Decides the AC1 assertion. Recommend **dark-present** so the timer is armed from first boot; requires the `doppler_secret` applied + verified as a precondition of the #6178 cutover provision (HARD gate — a partial edit bricks dark boot).
3. **OQ3** — timer cadence + promotion mechanism (CI gate vs fixed soak window). Blocks the absence-heartbeat grace window (must match cadence).
4. **OQ4** — cosign static-key custody + rotation recipe specifics (ADR-087 re-capture shape); leak → emergency `inngest-host-replace` with new baked pubkey (static keys have no revocation — residual, state in runbook).
5. **CPO sign-off** — confirm at the plan-review gate (pure-infra; low product surface).

## Sharp Edges
- A plan whose `## User-Brand Impact` section is empty/TBD fails deepen-plan Phase 4.6 — filled above.
- The boot isolation self-check is **exact-set** (`n_total -ne n_inngest`): every secret added to the isolated
  project MUST be in the regex or the host **fail-closes on boot**. Adding the digest pointer AND (if chosen)
  zot creds means the regex+floor must move together — a partial edit bricks the host at next replace.
- The four image pin sites are the **bootstrap image**, NOT the config bundle — do not touch them here.
- Use `Ref #6780` not `Closes` — closure is post-cutover-verification (see AC8/AC9).
